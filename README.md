from oni import CoherenceMetric, NeuralFirewall, ONIStack

# Calculate signal coherence (Cₛ)
metric = CoherenceMetric(reference_freq=40.0)  # 40 Hz gamma band
cs = metric.calculate(
    arrival_times=[0.0, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075],
    amplitudes=[100, 98, 102, 99]
)
print(f"Coherence Score: {cs:.3f}")  # 0 = untrusted, 1 = fully coherent

# Use the Neural Firewall
firewall = NeuralFirewall(threshold_high=0.6, threshold_low=0.3)
from oni.firewall import Signal
signal = Signal(arrival_times=[0.0, 0.025], amplitudes=[100, 102], authenticated=True)
result = firewall.filter(signal)
print(f"Decision: {result.decision.name}")  # ACCEPT, ACCEPT_FLAG, or REJECT

# Explore the 14-layer model
stack = ONIStack()
print(stack.layer(8).name)  # "Neural Gateway" - the firewall layer

## Objective

Brain-computer interfaces are being implanted in humans today, yet we lack standardized security frameworks for protecting neural communications. This project aims to:

1. **Establish shared vocabulary** — Define the attack surfaces, threat models, and defense mechanisms for neural interfaces before exploits emerge in the wild

2. **Bridge disciplines** — Translate cybersecurity principles into neuroscience contexts and vice versa, creating a common language for cross-domain collaboration

3. **Build proactively** — Develop security primitives (like the Coherence Metric) that can be implemented in hardware before BCIs reach mainstream adoption

4. **Invite scrutiny** — This framework is intentionally public and open. I want neuroscientists to challenge the biological assumptions, security researchers to find holes, and ethicists to identify governance gaps

**This is a living research project.** If you see flaws, have ideas, or want to collaborate — open an issue, submit a PR, or reach out directly. The goal isn't to be right; it's to build something robust enough to protect the most sensitive interface humanity will ever create: the one between technology and the mind.

## Key Components

### The 14-Layer ONI Model

<p align="center">
  <img src="MAIN/resources/images/oni-14-layer-hourglass.png" alt="ONI Framework 14-Layer Model" width="700">
</p>

Extends the classical OSI networking model with 7 additional layers for neural and cognitive systems:

| Layers | Domain | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **L1-L7** | Classical OSI Networking | Physical → Application (standard networking) |
| **L8** | Neural Gateway | **THE FIREWALL** — Bridge between silicon and biology |
| **L9-L10** | Signal Processing | Neural filtering, digitization, protocol encoding |
| **L11-L12** | Cognitive Transport | Session management, state tracking, reliable delivery |
| **L13-L14** | Semantic/Identity | Intent interpretation, ethics, continuity of self |

**Key Principle:**
- **OSI (L1-L7)** answers: *How does data move?*
- **ONI (L8-L14)** answers: *Should it move, can it be trusted, and what does it mean — especially when the endpoint is a human brain?*

**L8 (Neural Gateway) is the critical boundary** — most attacked, least standardized, most dangerous layer.

For complete layer definitions, see [ONI_LAYERS.md](MAIN/oni-framework/ONI_LAYERS.md) — the authoritative reference.

### The Coherence Metric

Mathematical framework for validating neural signal trustworthiness using entropy-based anomaly detection:

```
Cₛ = e^(−(σ²φ + σ²τ + σ²γ))
```

| Component | Variable | Measures | Security Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Phase** | σ²φ | Timing jitter | Detects out-of-sync signal injections |
| **Transport** | σ²τ | Pathway reliability | Flags signals bypassing biological routes |
| **Gain** | σ²γ | Amplitude stability | Catches over/under-powered attacks |

**Why Exponential Decay?** The formula models biological threshold behaviors from information theory. Total variance (σ²φ + σ²τ + σ²γ) represents Shannon entropy—the uncertainty across all signal dimensions. The exponential form creates sharp transitions: coherence remains high at low variance but collapses rapidly as variance increases, mirroring how neural systems gate signals for downstream propagation.

**Anomaly Detection Approach:**
1. **Baseline Establishment** — ML models trained on authentic neural signatures establish per-user variance thresholds for phase, transport, and gain
2. **Statistical Monitoring** — Incoming signals are continuously evaluated against learned baselines
3. **Deviation Flagging** — Signals exceeding standard deviation bounds trigger coherence score degradation
4. **Threshold Enforcement** — Cₛ below configurable threshold (default: 0.6) triggers rejection or enhanced scrutiny

**Interpretation:** Cₛ ranges from 0 (untrusted) to 1 (fully coherent). Signals below threshold are rejected before reaching neural tissue.

### Neural Signal Assurance Model (NSAM)

Physiology-first defense framework with checkpoints:

1. **Signal Existence** — Should this signal exist at all?
2. **Signal Integrity** — Is it biologically plausible?
3. **Intent & Context** — Does it make sense right now?
4. **Outcome Monitoring** — What effect is it causing?
5. **Human Sovereignty** — Does the human retain agency?

### Hardware Constraints (Neuralink N1 Reference)

| Constraint | Value | Security Implication |
|------------|-------|---------------------|
| Power budget | 25mW total | Firewall gets ~3-5mW max |
| Latency | <1ms required | Real-time validation needed |
| Electrodes | 1,024 channels | High-bandwidth monitoring |
| Form factor | ~1mm² | Minimal silicon for security |
