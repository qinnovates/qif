# ONI Framework

> An extensible framework for monitoring and securing neural communications, designed for transparency and interoperability across bio-digital systems.

## Objective

Brain-computer interfaces are being implanted in humans today, yet we lack standardized security frameworks for protecting neural communications. This project aims to:

1. **Establish shared vocabulary** — Define the attack surfaces, threat models, and defense mechanisms for neural interfaces before exploits emerge in the wild

2. **Bridge disciplines** — Translate cybersecurity principles into neuroscience contexts and vice versa, creating a common language for cross-domain collaboration

3. **Build proactively** — Develop security primitives (like the Coherence Metric) that can be implemented in hardware before BCIs reach mainstream adoption

4. **Invite scrutiny** — This framework is intentionally public and open. I want neuroscientists to challenge the biological assumptions, security researchers to find holes, and ethicists to identify governance gaps

**This is a living research project.** If you see flaws, have ideas, or want to collaborate — open an issue, submit a PR, or reach out directly. The goal isn't to be right; it's to build something robust enough to protect the most sensitive interface humanity will ever create: the one between technology and the mind.

## Key Components

### The 14-Layer ONI Model

Extends the traditional OSI model into biological territory:

| Layers | Domain | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1-7 | Traditional OSI | Physical → Application (standard networking) |
| 8-10 | Neural Interface | Electrodes, local field potentials, oscillatory patterns |
| 11-14 | Cognitive | Working memory, attention, executive function, identity |

### The Coherence Metric

Mathematical framework for validating neural signal trustworthiness:

```
Cₛ = e^(−(σ²φ + σ²τ + σ²γ))
```

| Component | Variable | Measures | Security Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Phase** | σ²φ | Timing jitter | Detects out-of-sync signal injections |
| **Transport** | σ²τ | Pathway reliability | Flags signals bypassing biological routes |
| **Gain** | σ²γ | Amplitude stability | Catches over/under-powered attacks |

**Interpretation:** Cₛ ranges from 0 (untrusted) to 1 (fully coherent). Signals below threshold are rejected before reaching neural tissue.

### Neural Signal Assurance Model (NSAM)

Physiology-first defense framework with checkpoints:

1. **Signal Existence** — Should this signal exist at all?
2. **Signal Integrity** — Is it biologically plausible?
3. **Intent & Context** — Does it make sense right now?
4. **Outcome Monitoring** — What effect is it causing?
5. **Human Sovereignty** — Does the human retain agency?
