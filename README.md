# ONI Framework
*"The OSI of Mind"*

> **ONI**: Organic Neurocomputing Interface — A 14-layer framework extending OSI for brain-computer interface (BCI) security.

An extensible framework for monitoring and securing neural communications, designed for transparency and interoperability across brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

## Privacy & Ethics Statement

**ONI is NOT a surveillance framework.** It exists to **protect** neural privacy, not compromise it. Signal integrity can be validated without reading thoughts. Attacks can be detected without decoding intent.

## Python Library

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/oni-framework.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/oni-framework)
[![Tests](https://github.com/qikevinl/ONI/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/qikevinl/ONI/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

The ONI Framework is available as a Python package for researchers and developers.

### Installation

```bash
pip install oni-framework
```

### Quick Start

```python
from oni import CoherenceMetric, NeuralFirewall, ONIStack

# Calculate signal coherence (Cₛ)
metric = CoherenceMetric(reference_freq=40.0)  # 40 Hz gamma band
cs = metric.calculate(
    arrival_times=[0.0, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075],
    amplitudes=[100, 98, 102, 99]
)
print(f"Coherence Score: {cs:.3f}")  # 0 = untrusted, 1 = fully coherent

# Use the Neural Firewall
firewall = NeuralFirewall(threshold_high=0.6, threshold_low=0.3)
from oni.firewall import Signal
signal = Signal(arrival_times=[0.0, 0.025], amplitudes=[100, 102], authenticated=True)
result = firewall.filter(signal)
print(f"Decision: {result.decision.name}")  # ACCEPT, ACCEPT_FLAG, or REJECT

# Explore the 14-layer model
stack = ONIStack()
print(stack.layer(8).name)  # "Neural Gateway" - the firewall layer
print(stack.ascii_diagram())  # Visual representation

# Neurosecurity: Kohno's CIA triad + BCI Anonymizer (NEW)
from oni.neurosecurity import NeurosecurityFirewall, BCIAnonymizer, ThreatType

# Validate signals against Kohno's threat model
ns_firewall = NeurosecurityFirewall()
# decision = ns_firewall.validate(signal)  # ALLOW, BLOCK, or EMERGENCY_SHUTOFF

# Filter privacy-sensitive information (BCI Anonymizer)
anonymizer = BCIAnonymizer()
# result = anonymizer.anonymize(signal_data)
# print(f"Privacy Score: {result.metrics.privacy_score}")  # Lower = more private
```

**Full documentation:** [MAIN/oni-framework/README.md](MAIN/oni-framework/README.md)

**Neurosecurity Integration:** Based on [Kohno et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.3171/2009.4.FOCUS0985) and [BCI Anonymizer patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140228701A1). See [NEUROSECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md](MAIN/NEUROSECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

### TARA - Neural Security Platform

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/oni-tara.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/oni-tara)

**TARA** (Telemetry Awareness and Response Analyzer) is a neural security platform for BCI monitoring, simulation, and attack testing. Named after the Buddhist goddess of protection, TARA provides real-time security analysis aligned with the ONI 14-layer model.

**Features:** Neural network simulation, attack pattern testing, Neural Signal Assurance Monitoring (NSAM), 3D brain topology visualization, and a Streamlit web dashboard.

```bash
# Installation
pip install oni-tara[full]  # Full installation with UI and simulation

# Launch the dashboard
tara ui
```

**Note:** TARA is a research and development tool for BCI security analysis. It requires `oni-framework` as a dependency and is intended for security researchers, not production BCI systems.

**Full documentation:** [MAIN/tara/README.md](MAIN/tara/README.md)

## Objective

Brain-computer interfaces are being implanted in humans today, yet we lack standardized security frameworks for protecting neural communications. This project aims to:

1. **Establish shared vocabulary** — Define the attack surfaces, threat models, and defense mechanisms for neural interfaces before exploits emerge in the wild

2. **Bridge disciplines** — Translate cybersecurity principles into neuroscience contexts and vice versa, creating a common language for cross-domain collaboration

3. **Build proactively** — Develop security primitives (like the Coherence Metric) that can be implemented in hardware before BCIs reach mainstream adoption

4. **Invite scrutiny** — This framework is intentionally public and open. I want neuroscientists to challenge the biological assumptions, security researchers to find holes, and ethicists to identify governance gaps

**This is a living research project.** If you see flaws, have ideas, or want to collaborate — open an issue, submit a PR, or reach out directly. The goal isn't to be right; it's to build something robust enough to protect the most sensitive interface humanity will ever create: the one between technology and the mind.

## Key Components

### The 14-Layer ONI Model

<p align="center">
  <img src="MAIN/resources/images/oni-14-layer-hourglass.png" alt="ONI Framework 14-Layer Model" width="700">
</p>

Extends the classical OSI networking model with 7 additional layers for neural and cognitive systems:

| Layers | Domain | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **L1-L7** | Classical OSI Networking | Physical → Application (standard networking) |
| **L8** | Neural Gateway | **THE FIREWALL** — Bridge between silicon and biology |
| **L9-L10** | Signal Processing | Neural filtering, digitization, protocol encoding |
| **L11-L12** | Cognitive Transport | Session management, state tracking, reliable delivery |
| **L13-L14** | Semantic/Identity | Intent interpretation, ethics, continuity of self |

**Key Principle:**
- **OSI (L1-L7)** answers: *How does data move?*
- **ONI (L8-L14)** answers: *Should it move, can it be trusted, and what does it mean — especially when the endpoint is a human brain?*

**L8 (Neural Gateway) is the critical boundary** — most attacked, least standardized, most dangerous layer.

For complete layer definitions, see [ONI_LAYERS.md](MAIN/oni-framework/ONI_LAYERS.md) — the authoritative reference.

### The Coherence Metric

Mathematical framework for validating neural signal trustworthiness:

```
Cₛ = e^(−(σ²φ + σ²τ + σ²γ))
```

| Component | Variable | Measures | Security Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Phase** | σ²φ | Timing jitter | Detects out-of-sync signal injections |
| **Transport** | σ²τ | Pathway reliability | Flags signals bypassing biological routes |
| **Gain** | σ²γ | Amplitude stability | Catches over/under-powered attacks |

**Interpretation:** Cₛ ranges from 0 (untrusted) to 1 (fully coherent). Signals below threshold are rejected before reaching neural tissue.

### Neural Signal Assurance Model (NSAM)

Physiology-first defense framework with checkpoints:

1. **Signal Existence** — Should this signal exist at all?
2. **Signal Integrity** — Is it biologically plausible?
3. **Intent & Context** — Does it make sense right now?
4. **Outcome Monitoring** — What effect is it causing?
5. **Human Sovereignty** — Does the human retain agency?

## Quick Reference

### Attack Surfaces by Layer

| Layer | Domain | Attack Surface | Example Threat |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| L1-L4 | OSI | Network infrastructure | MitM, DDoS, BlueBorne-style exploits |
| L5-L7 | OSI | Application protocols | Packet injection, API exploits |
| **L8** | **Gateway** | **Neural boundary** | **Bypass attacks, unauthorized write access** |
| L9 | Signal | Hardware/DSP | Signal injection, jamming, impedance manipulation |
| L10-L11 | Protocol | Neural encoding | Protocol manipulation, session hijacking |
| L12-L13 | Cognitive | State/Intent | Context corruption, semantic attacks |
| L14 | Identity | Self-model | Long-term manipulation, identity attacks |

**External Physical Threats** (documented in [ONI_LAYERS.md](MAIN/oni-framework/ONI_LAYERS.md)):
- MRI exposure, electromagnetic interference, physical trauma, intentional jamming, proximity attacks (ProxMark-style)

### Hardware Constraints (Neuralink N1 Reference)

| Constraint | Value | Security Implication |
|------------|-------|---------------------|
| Power budget | 25mW total | Firewall gets ~3-5mW max |
| Latency | <1ms required | Real-time validation needed |
| Electrodes | 1,024 channels | High-bandwidth monitoring |
| Form factor | ~1mm² | Minimal silicon for security |
