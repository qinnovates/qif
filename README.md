## The Framework (v2 — February 2026)

> A ground-up architectural redesign of BCI security, built from neuroscience constraints rather than retrofitted IT models.

The original model placed the Neural Gateway at Layer 8 (middle of a 14-layer stack). BCIs are physical hardware — they belong adjacent to OSI Layer 1. Everything needed to be rebuilt from that realization.

**9 documents, designed to be read in order:**

## Why This Exists

Brain-computer interfaces are being implanted in humans today. Neuralink, BrainGate, and dozens of clinical trials are creating direct connections between silicon and neural tissue — yet no universal security standard exists to protect the people who depend on them.

This framework translates neuroethical principles — cognitive liberty, mental privacy, mental integrity, psychological continuity — into testable, implementable security controls.

### The Priority Stack

```
DONE     Understand the brain (neuroscience, BCI capabilities, quantum biology)
DONE     Build the model (funnel, gap analysis, Q integer)
NOW      Ethics & governance — who owns neural data? consent? post-deployment?
NEXT     Classical security tools (TARA with measurable signals)
LATER    Quantum security tools (when quantum measurement advances)
```

### Why Governance First

The original v1 model relied on concepts of self, consciousness, and identity (L13-L14) — things we cannot measure, model, or define with math or science. Building security on unmeasurable abstractions is the wrong order. Start with what we can measure: ethical constraints and testable controls.

The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know. A framework built on that humility — one that labels its gaps instead of hiding them — is more trustworthy than one that claims to have all the answers.
