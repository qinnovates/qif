# Critical Concerns

Open problems in BCI security that no single framework can solve alone. These require community discussion, cross-disciplinary research, and honest acknowledgment of what current approaches (including QIF) cannot do.

Each document in this folder describes a specific threat class, what current defenses cover, what they miss, and what the community needs to build.

## Documents

| Document | Threat Class | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [ROGUE-AI-AND-INTERNAL-THREATS.md](ROGUE-AI-AND-INTERNAL-THREATS.md) | Software bugs, hardware glitches, rogue AI in closed-loop BCIs | Open discussion |

## How to Contribute

These are open questions. If you have expertise in adversarial ML, BCI safety engineering, neurostimulation protocols, or formal verification, these problems need your attention. File an issue, open a PR, or reach out directly.

The goal is not to claim QIF solves everything. The goal is to map exactly where the gaps are so the community can close them together.
