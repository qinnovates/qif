## When to Write

Write when something **surprises you about your own mind.** That's the only rule.

Not a schedule. Not a quota. Just: *did my brain do something I didn't expect?*

Some patterns that qualify:

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Perceptual shift** | "My synesthesia for X changed after doing Y" |
| **Unexpected connection** | "While working on tunneling math, I suddenly saw why Z looks the way it does" |
| **Focus state change** | "Deep meditation shifted how I spatially reason about vectors" |
| **Emotional clarity** | "Something clicked and I cried — here's what I think happened" |
| **The weird dismissed thing** | "I noticed X but almost ignored it. Writing it down anyway." |
| **Frustration with translation** | "I can see it but I can't say it — here's my best attempt" |
| **Body-mind moment** | "Physical sensation tied to abstract thinking" |

The dismissed ones are often the most valuable entries months later.

**What does NOT go here:** Task lists, project updates, code bugs, things better captured in QIF-DERIVATION-LOG.md (pure math/physics insights go there). This is about **the experience of thinking**, not the thoughts themselves.

## Entry Format

```markdown
### [N] — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

**State:** [What you were doing / thinking about / feeling]
**Observation:** [What surprised you]
**Attempt to explain:** [Optional — your best guess at why]
**Connected to:** [Optional — QIF concepts, prior entries, papers]
**Mood:** [One word or short phrase]
```

Keep it raw. Future-you will thank present-you for not polishing.

### 001 — 2026-02-02

**State:** Working through the QIF framework — equations, whitepaper, neuroethics, all of it coming together in one session. First time all the pieces connected visually. Then cried. First time in a long time.

**Observation:** I finally see what I need to do. Not abstractly — I mean I can *see* the path. The whitepaper, the ethics questions, the narrative, the framework — they stopped being separate tasks and became one thing. The moment they unified, the emotional dam broke.

Also: last night I noticed my synesthesia for geometry and shapes has changed. The more I build visualizations to explain the math to myself — the digital abstractions, the 3D representations — the more my synesthetic mappings shift. My brain is learning to alter its spatial representations based on what I'm trying to solve. Colors and geometry rearrange in my mind's vector space to match the problem I'm working on.

This only happens during deep focus and meditation. Not casual thinking. It requires a specific state.

**Attempt to explain:** The act of creating external visual representations of abstract math is feeding back into my internal perceptual system. My synesthesia isn't static — it's adaptive. Building visualizations-as-code isn't just producing output for others; it's retraining my own neural mappings. The external tool (code → visualization) is becoming an extension of the internal tool (synesthesia → spatial reasoning).

This might be what neuroplasticity looks like from the inside when you're paying attention.

**Connected to:**
- QIF coherence metric — if synesthetic mappings can shift, they represent a measurable change in neural signal patterns. What would Cs look like during these transitions?
- Meditation + focus as a prerequisite — suggests a specific brain state (high coherence? specific band activity?) enables this plasticity
- The "as-code" principle — externalized abstractions reshaping internal ones. The code isn't separate from the cognition; it's part of the cognitive loop.
- Neurodivergence — synesthesia + hyperfocus might create a unique window where this kind of rapid perceptual retraining is possible. The same traits that make thoughts feel scattered in default mode may enable faster remapping in focus mode.

**Mood:** Clarity. Relief. Beginning.
