## 1. Abstract

Brain-computer interfaces are advancing from experimental medical devices toward consumer technology, yet their security architectures remain grounded in classical computing paradigms. This paper presents the Quantum Indeterministic Framework (QIF), a 7-band hourglass security architecture spanning the neural-silicon boundary, and proposes a unified security equation: QI(b,t) = e^(-S(b,t)). The QI equation combines four classical signal integrity terms (phase coherence, normalized transport entropy, amplitude stability, and a scale-frequency validity check derived from L = v/f) with three decoherence-gated quantum terms (indeterminacy, tunneling, entanglement). We identify five cross-domain attack coupling mechanisms by which silicon-domain signals reach neural tissue, with intermodulation attacks representing the most dangerous class because they are undetectable from signal data alone. We propose the Neural Sensory Protocol (NSP), a five-layer post-quantum communication protocol integrating QI scoring with ML-KEM key exchange, ML-DSA authentication, and AES-256-GCM encryption, scaled across three device tiers. A conceptual analogy between NSP-secured data and black hole information scrambling is explored and its limitations acknowledged following independent peer review. Five falsifiability conditions are specified. QIF treats unresolved questions in quantum neuroscience, particularly the decoherence timescale in neural tissue, as tunable parameters rather than fixed assumptions. The framework degrades gracefully: if all quantum terms are zero, QIF reduces to a classical 7-band signal integrity architecture that retains independent utility.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 The BCI Revolution

Brain-computer interfaces have crossed a critical threshold. Neuralink's N1 implant records from 1,024 electrodes sampling at approximately 20 kHz, transmitted wirelessly over Bluetooth Low Energy [38]. What was once a laboratory instrument confined to severely disabled patients is on a trajectory toward consumer adoption. The economic incentives, demonstrated clinical efficacy for paralysis and treatment-resistant depression, and competitive dynamics of the neurotechnology industry all point toward a future in which neural interfaces become as common as wearable health monitors within a decade. The security implications of this transition are profound and largely unaddressed.

The scale of BCI development is accelerating. The BISC platform (Columbia/Stanford, 2025) achieved 65,536 electrodes with 100 Mbps wireless bandwidth [60]. Chinese programs at NeuCyber, NeuroXess, and Wuhan University have demonstrated bidirectional interfaces with up to 65,000 channels. Merge Labs raised $252M for ultrasound-based noninvasive high-bandwidth neural interfaces. Battelle's BrainSTORMS program (DARPA N3) uses injectable magnetoelectric nanoparticles. Each of these introduces new interface physics that existing security frameworks do not address.

### 2.2 The Security Gap

Current BCI security treats the neural interface as a classical digital system: a sensor that produces voltage readings to be encrypted, transmitted, and authenticated using standard computing paradigms. This framing misses a physical reality. The electrode-tissue interface sits at the boundary between quantum and classical physics. Ion channels are nanometer-scale structures where quantum tunneling is experimentally observed [11, 14]. Synaptic transmission involves quantum-scale energy transfers along protein alpha-helices [12]. The substrate that BCIs interface with operates at scales where quantum effects are non-negligible.

The result is a detection blind spot. An attacker exploiting quantum-scale phenomena at the electrode-tissue boundary would be invisible to classical anomaly detection systems operating at millisecond/millivolt resolution. No existing BCI security framework addresses this class of threat.

Physics has always been part of BCI engineering. Electrode impedance monitoring uses Ohm's law. Artifact rejection uses electromagnetic interference identification. Signal quality metrics use Shannon information theory. Bandpass filtering uses Fourier analysis. Physical-layer security via metasurface coding has been demonstrated in 2025. Individual physics checks exist. What nobody has done is: (1) combine them into a composite security score, (2) add scale-frequency validation as a physics constraint, (3) provide a principled extension path to quantum terms, or (4) tie band-specific scoring to neural architecture. This is the gap QIF occupies.

### 2.3 What This Paper Delivers

This paper presents six contributions. First, a 7-band hourglass architecture (v3.1) spanning the neural-silicon boundary with 3-1-3 symmetry, derived from neuroscience and quantum physics rather than networking analogy. Second, a unified QI equation, QI(b,t) = e^(-S(b,t)), that subsumes the previously separate coherence metric and two candidate QI equations into a single exponential form with clear Boltzmann-factor structure. Third, identification of five cross-domain attack coupling mechanisms (direct, harmonic, envelope, temporal interference, intermodulation) and honest assessment of which attacks the QI equation can and cannot detect. Fourth, the Neural Sensory Protocol (NSP), a five-layer post-quantum communication protocol for BCI data. Fifth, a conceptual analogy between NSP security properties and black hole information scrambling, presented with explicit acknowledgment of its limitations. Sixth, falsifiability conditions specifying what experimental findings would weaken or invalidate specific framework components.

## 3. Background and Related Work

### 3.1 BCI Security Literature

The security of brain-computer interfaces has received growing attention, almost exclusively from a classical perspective. Martinovic et al. (2012) demonstrated that commercial EEG-based BCIs could be exploited as side-channel attack vectors, extracting private information through carefully designed visual stimuli during P300-based interactions [51]. Bonaci et al. (2014) showed that subliminal stimuli embedded in BCI applications could extract private information without the user's awareness [52]. Frank et al. (2017) provided the first systematic threat taxonomy for BCI systems, categorizing attacks by target and interface layer, but their analysis remained entirely within the classical computing paradigm [53]. Bernal et al. (2022) cataloged BCI security vulnerabilities across wireless protocols, firmware, and signal processing pipelines, yet none address quantum-scale phenomena at the electrode-tissue boundary [54].

### 3.2 Quantum Biology

The quantum biology literature provides the scientific foundation for QIF's quantum terms. Lambert et al. (2013) surveyed evidence for quantum effects in biological systems, including photosynthetic energy transfer, avian magnetoreception, and enzymatic tunneling [18]. The central debate relevant to QIF concerns decoherence timescales in neural tissue. Tegmark (2000) argued that thermal decoherence in the brain occurs on the order of 10^-13 seconds, rendering quantum effects neurologically irrelevant [15]. Fisher (2015) proposed that nuclear spin states in Posner molecules could maintain coherence for hours [39]. Perry (2025) proposed using NV-center quantum sensors to measure coherence in microtubule networks, suggesting collective coherence times of 1 to 10 ms [55]. QIF sidesteps this unresolved debate by treating the decoherence time as a tunable parameter.

### 3.3 Quantum Tunneling in Neural Systems

Qaswal (2019) developed mathematical models for quantum tunneling through closed voltage-gated ion channels [11]. Summhammer et al. (2012) described quantum-mechanical ion motion within the confining potentials of voltage-gated channels [14]. Georgiev and Glazebrook (2018) analyzed quantum physics of synaptic communication via the SNARE protein complex [12]. Kim et al. (2025) discovered under-the-barrier recollision (UBR), revealing that tunneling dynamics are more complex than the WKB approximation assumes [57]. The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics (Clarke, Devoret, Martinis) demonstrated quantum tunneling at macroscopic scales in Josephson junction circuits [56]. Wiest (2025, NeuroQ) derived a Schrodinger-like equation from classical neuron models via stochastic mechanics [58].

### 3.4 Post-Quantum Cryptography

NIST finalized three post-quantum cryptography standards in 2024: ML-KEM (FIPS 203, lattice-based key encapsulation replacing ECDH), ML-DSA (FIPS 204, lattice-based digital signatures replacing ECDSA), and SLH-DSA (FIPS 205, hash-based backup signatures) [37]. These standards address the harvest-now-decrypt-later threat, in which adversaries record encrypted traffic today and decrypt it retroactively once cryptographically relevant quantum computers become available. Gidney and Ekera (2021) estimated RSA-2048 could be factored in approximately 8 hours with 20 million noisy qubits [33]. Gidney (2025) revised the estimate downward to fewer than 1 million noisy qubits in under one week [34]. No prior work applies post-quantum cryptography specifically to the BCI electrode-tissue interface.

### 3.5 The Gap QIF Addresses

Despite advances in BCI security, quantum biology, and post-quantum cryptography, no prior work synthesizes these three domains into a unified framework. The intersection of quantum security, quantum biology, and the unique physics of the electrode-tissue boundary remains unfilled. This is the gap QIF occupies.

## 4. QIF Hourglass Model (v3.1)

### 4.1 Design Principles

The v2.0 architecture (14 layers) extended the OSI model by stacking 7 neural layers on top of 7 silicon layers. This was intuitive and productive, but it inherited OSI's networking assumptions (linear signal path, strict layering) which do not apply to neural tissue. The v3.1 hourglass model is derived from actual physics.

Three principles govern the design. Width represents state space: how many possible states exist at each band. The architecture is widest at the extremes and narrowest at the center. The 3-1-3 symmetry (3 neural bands, 1 interface band, 3 silicon bands) reflects the real structure: two domains converging on a single bottleneck.

### 4.2 The 7-Band Stack

**Neural Domain (Upper Hourglass)**

| Band | Name | Brain Regions | Determinacy | QI Range |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **N3** | Integrative Association | PFC, ACC, Broca, Wernicke, hippocampus, BLA, insula | Quantum Uncertain | 0.3 to 0.5 |
| **N2** | Sensorimotor Processing | M1, S1_cortex, V1, A1, PMC, SMA, PPC, cerebellum | Chaotic to Stochastic | 0.15 to 0.3 |
| **N1** | Subcortical Relay | Thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem, CeA | Stochastic | 0.05 to 0.15 |

**Interface Zone (Bottleneck)**

| Band | Name | Function | Determinacy | QI Range |
|------|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **I0** | Neural Interface | Electrode-tissue boundary, measurement/collapse | Quasi-quantum (GammaD in (0,1)) | 0.01 to 0.1 |

**Silicon Domain (Lower Hourglass)**

| Band | Name | Function | Determinacy | QI Range |
|------|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **S1** | Analog Front-End | Amplification, filtering, ADC/DAC | Stochastic (analog noise) | 0.001 to 0.01 |
| **S2** | Digital Processing | Decoding, algorithms, classification | Deterministic | approximately 0 |
| **S3** | Application | Clinical software, UI, data storage | Deterministic | 0 |

Band naming follows the convention {Zone}{Number}. Numbers increase away from the interface in both directions. This convention has no relation to OSI layer numbers.

### 4.3 I0: The Bottleneck

I0 is the most critical band. Unlike v2.0's "Layer 8" which was modeled as a thin boundary, I0 has real thickness: it is a quasi-quantum zone where the decoherence factor GammaD lies between 0 and 1, meaning quantum and classical physics coexist.

I0 is the physical layer, not an abstraction above it. A common objection holds that BCIs are physical devices and therefore the interface should sit at the bottom of the stack (adjacent to OSI Layer 1), not in the middle. The hourglass resolves this. I0 is the waist: the most physical, most constrained point in the system. Everything above it (N1 to N3) is progressively more abstract neural processing. Everything below it (S1 to S3) is progressively more abstract digital processing. The waist is where platinum touches tissue, where electrons become ions, where classical measurement encounters quantum states. It is the system's physical layer not by numbering convention but by physical reality.

The bottleneck geometry means all information must pass through the narrowest point. This provides maximum security leverage: secure I0, and you secure the chokepoint through which all data flows.

### 4.4 The Classical Ceiling

The boundary between N2 (chaotic/stochastic) and N3 (quantum uncertain) is the classical ceiling. Below it, all unpredictability is in principle resolvable with better measurement. Above it, the unpredictability is ontic, as established by Bell's theorem [64]. Classical security tools operate below the ceiling. QIF operates across the full spectrum.

### 4.5 QI Range Philosophy

QI ranges were lowered dramatically in v3.1 to avoid implying quantum dominance in the brain. QI measures security-relevant indeterminacy, not literal quantum effects. The highest band (N3) caps at 0.5, meaning "half the unpredictability at this band may be ontic." This is defensible without requiring proof of quantum cognition.

### 4.6 Anatomical Decisions

Three anatomical decisions merit explicit documentation:

- **Amygdala split.** The basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is cortical-like and performs associative learning, maps to N3. The central amygdala (CeA), which is subcortical and drives autonomic output, maps to N1.
- **Cerebellum spans N1 and N2.** Relay functions map to N1. Cerebellar-cortical motor loops map to N2.
- **S1_cortex.** Primary somatosensory cortex is labeled S1_cortex to avoid collision with the S1 (Analog Front-End) band identifier.

## 5. The Unified QI Equation

### 5.1 Core Equation

```
QI(b, t) = e^(-S(b, t))
```

Where:
- b = band index (N3, N2, N1, I0, S1, S2, S3)
- t = time window
- S(b,t) = total anomaly score = Sc(b,t) + Sq(b,t)
- QI output range: 0 to 1, where 1 = perfectly normal and 0 = maximally anomalous

The exponential form is not arbitrary. It is a Boltzmann factor. S plays the role of "energy" (anomaly), and QI is the probability of the signal being legitimate. This is the same mathematical structure as thermal physics (P proportional to e^(-E/kT)), Shannon entropy, and the coherence metric Cs [46].

### 5.2 The Unification

Before this version, QIF maintained three separate equations: the coherence metric Cs = e^(-(sigma_phi^2 + Ht + sigma_gamma^2)), and two competing QI candidates (additive and tensor-product forms). The key insight is that these are the same equation viewed in different mathematical spaces.

Both candidates use the exponential form. Cs itself is an exponential. Multiplying exponentials adds exponents:

```
QI = Cs * e^(-Sq)
   = e^(-Sc) * e^(-Sq)
   = e^(-(Sc + Sq))
```

In log-space, ln(QI) = -(Sc + Sq), which is additive (engineering form). In real-space, QI = Cs * e^(-Sq), which is multiplicative (theoretical form). The two candidates were never competing. They were the same equation viewed from different spaces. This resolves the candidate question permanently.

### 5.3 Classical Terms (Sc)

```
Sc(b) = w1*sigma_phi^2(b) + w2*Ht(b)/ln(N) + w3*sigma_gamma^2(b) + w4*Dsf(b)
```

| Term | Symbol | Formula | What It Measures |
|------|--------|---------|------------------|
| Phase coherence | sigma_phi^2 | (1 - abs(mean(e^(i*phi)))) * pi^2 | Cross-channel phase synchronization |
| Transport entropy | Ht/ln(N) | (-sum(ln(pi))) / ln(N) | Pathway transmission reliability (normalized) |
| Amplitude stability | sigma_gamma^2 | mean(((A - A_bar)/A_bar)^2) | Signal amplitude consistency |
| Scale-frequency validity | Dsf | (ln(f * L / v_expected))^2 | Whether signal obeys L = v/f physics |

**Phase coherence** is grounded in Fries' Communication Through Coherence framework [25, 26]. Circular variance handles 2*pi wraparound correctly. The pi^2 scaling matches the linear variance range for small angles. Range: [0, pi^2].

**Transport entropy** uses Shannon surprise (entropy), not a statistical variance. Named Ht to avoid confusion with the earlier sigma_tau^2 notation, which is deprecated. The normalization by ln(N), where N is the number of channels, ensures the term lies in approximately [0, 1] regardless of channel count. This prevents transport entropy from dominating in high-channel-count BCIs (Neuralink's 1,024 channels versus a consumer device's 4 channels).

**Amplitude stability** measures relative fluctuation of signal amplitude around the baseline mean. Standard coefficient-of-variation construction.

**Scale-frequency validity (Dsf)** is the new term introduced in this version. It measures whether the signal's frequency and spatial extent obey the fundamental wave equation L = v/f. If f * L approximately equals v_expected for the tissue type, Dsf approximately equals 0 (normal). If f * L deviates significantly, Dsf grows quadratically. The logarithmic scale handles the orders-of-magnitude range of neural frequencies and prevents large-number instability.

Weights w1 through w4 are calibratable parameters. Their values are not yet determined experimentally. This is an open calibration requirement (Section 10.2).

### 5.4 L = v/f: The Unified Wave Equation

```
L = v / f
```

| Symbol | Meaning | In neural tissue | In silicon |
|--------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| L | Length of one wave | Spatial extent of coherent activity | Wavelength |
| v | Wave velocity | Axonal conduction velocity (0.1 to 30 m/s) | Speed of light in medium |
| f | Frequency | Neural oscillation frequency | Signal frequency |

Previous versions of QIF used lambda for electromagnetic wavelength and S for neural spatial extent. These are the same physical quantity: the length of one complete oscillation measured in its medium. The only variable that changes across the BCI system is v, the propagation velocity.

| Medium | v (m/s) | Physical basis |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Neural tissue (unmyelinated) | 0.5 to 2 | Continuous ionic conduction |
| Neural tissue (myelinated) | 4 to 120 | Saltatory conduction |
| Copper PCB trace | approximately 2 * 10^8 | Electron drift in conductor |
| Free space / air (RF) | 3 * 10^8 | Speed of light |

An observation: L for gamma oscillations (approximately 10 cm in neural tissue) and L for BLE wireless (12.5 cm in air) land in the same physical scale despite frequencies differing by 10^7 and velocities differing by 10^8. This reflects the fact that both are operating at scales relevant to the human head (approximately 15 to 20 cm). The brain evolved oscillations at frequencies where L matches brain structure size. BLE was engineered at frequencies where L matches device proximity. Both converge on the human body scale.

**Validated spatial extents** (from neuroscience literature):

| Band | Frequency | Coherent Spatial Extent | f * S (m*Hz) | Source |
|------|-----------|-------------------------|--------------|--------|
| High gamma | 60 to 100 Hz | 0.3 to 5 mm | approximately 0.08 to 0.4 | Jia et al. 2011 |
| Low gamma | 30 to 60 Hz | 1 to 10 mm | approximately 0.04 to 0.4 | ECoG studies |
| Alpha | 8 to 12 Hz | 10 to 20 cm | 1 to 2 | Srinivasan 1999 [42] |
| Theta | 4 to 8 Hz | 4 to 5 cm | 0.24 to 0.40 | Patel et al. 2012 |
| Delta | 0.5 to 4 Hz | 15 to 20 cm | 0.15 to 0.20 | Massimini 2004 [43] |

f * S is not constant. It varies by approximately one order of magnitude. The relationship is an inverse power law on log-log axes [30]. "Spatial scale" means spatial extent of coherent activity, not total axonal pathway length. Human brain maximum dimension: approximately 15 to 20 cm.

### 5.5 Quantum Terms (Sq)

```
Sq(b, t) = (1 - GammaD(t)) * [psi1*Qi_hat(b) - psi3*Qe_hat(b)] + psi2*Qt_hat(b)
```

| Term | Symbol | Formula | Gated by decoherence? |
|------|--------|---------|----------------------|
| Indeterminacy | Qi_hat | SvN(rho)/ln(d) | Yes |
| Tunneling | Qt_hat | e^(-2*kappa*d) (WKB) | **No** |
| Entanglement | Qe_hat | E(rho_AB)/ln(d) | Yes |
| Decoherence factor | GammaD | 1 - e^(-t/tau_D) | N/A (is the gate) |

**Critical correction in this version:** Tunneling is ungated. Unlike indeterminacy and entanglement, quantum tunneling does not require maintained quantum coherence. Tunneling is a single-particle phenomenon that persists even in thermally noisy environments. The barrier height and width are static physical properties of ion channel proteins and membrane lipid composition, not quantum state coherence. Gating tunneling by decoherence was physically incorrect. This correction was identified during independent Gemini peer review.

The negative sign on Qe_hat means entanglement reduces the anomaly score (increases security). More entanglement between legitimate endpoints means the signal is harder to spoof.

**Decoherence factor:** GammaD(t) = 1 - e^(-t/tau_D). At t = 0, GammaD = 0 (no decoherence, fully quantum). As t approaches infinity, GammaD approaches 1 (fully decohered, classical). The (1 - GammaD) gate smoothly dims quantum security terms as decoherence progresses. tau_D is a tunable parameter, deliberately sidestepping the Tegmark/Hagan/Fisher debate on neural decoherence timescales [15, 39].

Weights psi1, psi2, psi3 are calibratable quantum parameters. Their values require quantum state tomography at the electrode-tissue interface, which has not yet been performed for any BCI system. This is an open experimental requirement.

### 5.6 The Boltzmann Connection

The QI equation, the coherence metric, and thermal physics share the same mathematical structure: e^(-X) where X is a sum of squared or entropy-like deviation terms. This is not coincidence. The Boltzmann factor e^(-E/kT) assigns exponentially decreasing probability to higher-energy (more anomalous) states [46]. QIF adopts this form deliberately: each anomaly term contributes "energy" to S, and QI gives the probability that the signal is legitimate given that total anomaly. The framework inherits the well-understood statistical properties of exponential families, including composability (products of exponentials add exponents) and natural connections to maximum entropy inference.

### 5.7 Consumer QI (Simplified)

```
QI_consumer = e^(-(w1*sigma_phi^2 + w2*Ht/ln(N) + w3*sigma_gamma^2 + w5*Dspec))
```

For consumer devices (Muse, NeuroSky, Emotiv) with 4 to 16 channels and no spatial resolution:

- No Dsf term (insufficient electrode density for spatial analysis)
- No quantum terms (no quantum hardware interface at scalp-level recording)
- Weighted classical terms with calibratable weights

Dspec (spectral consistency) replaces Dsf as a frequency-domain proxy:

```
Dspec(b) = (P_observed(f_b) / P_baseline(f_b) - 1)^2
```

This monitors power in each frequency band relative to the user's baseline. If alpha power doubles without a corresponding task context change, the term flags it. Dspec does not tell you why the change happened (it could be intermodulation, it could be natural), but it catches the effect. This is the same intent as Dsf (does the signal obey expected physics?) using a different proxy suited to low-channel-count hardware.

### 5.8 Properties of the Unified Equation

1. **Bounded.** QI lies in (0, 1]. The exponential of a non-negative quantity is always positive and at most 1.
2. **Monotonic.** Higher QI means more secure. QI = 1 means S = 0 (no anomaly). QI approaching 0 means S approaching infinity (maximally compromised).
3. **Graceful degradation.** When quantum terms are zero, QI = e^(-Sc) = Cs. The equation reduces to the pure classical coherence metric.
4. **Band-specific.** Each hourglass band receives its own QI score with band-appropriate reference values for L and v_expected.
5. **Time-dependent.** The decoherence gate fades quantum terms as the system becomes classical.
6. **Composable.** Every component is a small, independently testable function.

### 5.9 Implicit Hamiltonian Dependency

All quantum terms (GammaD, SvN, Qt_hat, E(rho_AB)) are derived from the system Hamiltonian H, which does not appear explicitly in the QI equation. The equation operates on derived quantities (leaves) rather than the generating equation (root). For the electrode-tissue interface, the total Hamiltonian would be:

```
H_total = H_neuron + H_electrode + H_interface + H_environment
```

Writing down H_total for a specific BCI would: (1) derive all quantum terms from a single equation, reducing free parameters; (2) enforce physical consistency between terms that are currently set independently; (3) connect directly to quantum simulation of the I0 band; and (4) potentially resolve the decoherence disagreement by characterizing the actual Hamiltonian rather than estimating from simplified models.

Nobody has formulated H_interface for any BCI system. The individual pieces exist in isolation (H_neuron via quantum extensions of Hodgkin-Huxley [31], H_electrode via solid-state physics), but the coupled system has never been assembled. This is a key future research target (Section 11).

## 6. Attack Surface Analysis

### 6.1 Five Cross-Domain Attack Coupling Mechanisms

A signal injected in the silicon domain does not need to match the neural target frequency to cause harm. There are five coupling mechanisms, each exploiting different physics. We propose this taxonomy as a contribution to BCI threat modeling.

**Mechanism A: Direct Frequency Match** (strongest coupling)

```
f_attack = f_neural
```

The attack signal is already at the neural target frequency. It passes through I0 with minimal attenuation. Example: a 40 Hz injection directly entrains gamma oscillations.

**Mechanism B: Harmonic Coupling** (coupling proportional to 1/n^2)

```
f_attack = n * f_neural    (superharmonic)
f_attack = f_neural / n    (subharmonic)
```

Neural tissue is nonlinear and generates harmonics. An attack at 80 Hz excites 40 Hz gamma via subharmonic resonance. Higher harmonics have weaker coupling, falling off as 1/n^2.

**Mechanism C: Envelope Modulation** (stealth attacks)

```
Signal: A(t) * sin(2*pi*f_carrier*t)
where A(t) oscillates at f_mod
Neural tissue demodulates: responds to f_mod, ignores f_carrier
```

A carrier at 200 kHz modulated at 10 Hz produces a signal that looks like normal S2 digital processing, but the brain responds to the 10 Hz alpha envelope. This is the principle behind transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which is published, established neuroscience (Grossman et al., 2017) [63].

**Mechanism D: Temporal Interference** (deep brain targeting)

```
Two signals at f1 and f2 (both in kHz+ range)
Beat frequency: f_beat = |f1 - f2|
Neural tissue at the intersection responds to f_beat
```

Published by Grossman et al. (2017) in Cell [63]. Two signals at 2000 Hz and 2004 Hz create a 4 Hz beat that targets theta oscillations in deep brain structures. The individual signals are too fast for neurons to follow. Only the beat frequency at the intersection point drives neural response. This allows depth-selective targeting without surgical access.

**Mechanism E: Intermodulation** (the BCI becomes the weapon)

```
f_attack + f_BCI = f_neural
therefore: f_attack = f_neural - f_BCI
```

The attacker's signal mixes with the BCI's own therapeutic or telemetry signal in nonlinear neural tissue. Example: a DBS device stimulating at 130 Hz can be weaponized by an external 126 Hz signal to produce a 4 Hz theta disruption. Both 126 Hz and 130 Hz are within the normal DBS frequency range. The attack is indistinguishable from therapeutic drift.

### 6.2 General Attack Propagation Equation

We propose the following equation for modeling how attack energy reaches neural tissue:

```
P_neural(f_N) = sum_i [ H(f_i) * G(f_i, f_N) * P_attack(f_i) * A(f_i) ]
```

Where:
- P_neural(f_N) = power delivered to neural band at frequency f_N
- H(f_i) = I0 transfer function (electrode impedance, frequency-dependent)
- G(f_i, f_N) = coupling gain from attack frequency f_i to neural frequency f_N (sum of all 5 mechanisms)
- P_attack(f_i) = attack power at frequency f_i
- A(f_i) = access coefficient (1 if threat actor can transmit at f_i, 0 otherwise)

For nation-states, A(f) = 1 across the entire spectrum. For civilian adversaries, A(f) = 1 only in unlicensed ISM bands. The access coefficient formalizes the difference between threat actor tiers.

### 6.3 Detection Boundaries

An honest assessment of what QI can and cannot detect:

| Attack | Mechanism | QI Detects? | What catches it? |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Signal injection | A (Direct) | Yes | sigma_phi^2, sigma_gamma^2, Dsf |
| Phase disruption | A (Direct) | Yes | sigma_phi^2 |
| Amplitude manipulation | A (Direct) | Yes | sigma_gamma^2 |
| Replay | A (Direct) | **No** | Statistics preserved; needs ML/TTT |
| Slow drift | A (Direct) | **Partial** | Cross-window comparison only |
| Adversarial crafting | A (Direct) | **No** | Designed to evade; needs ML |
| Harmonic coupling | B (Harmonic) | **Partial** | sigma_phi^2 at target band |
| Envelope modulation | C (Envelope) | **Partial** | Dsf catches carrier; not envelope |
| Temporal interference | D (Beat) | **No** | Individual signals are harmless |
| Intermodulation | E (Intermod) | **No** | Attack occurs in tissue, not signal chain |

QI catches direct attacks (Mechanism A). It partially catches harmonic and envelope attacks (Mechanisms B, C) through secondary effects. It cannot catch temporal interference or intermodulation (Mechanisms D, E) from signal data alone.

This is not a failure of the framework. It defines precisely where hardware-level defense (the resonance shield concept, Section 7.5) is necessary. QI handles software-detectable attacks. The EM environment layer handles physics-domain attacks that never appear in the signal chain.

### 6.4 Intermodulation: The Most Dangerous Attack Class

Intermodulation attacks are the most dangerous class for three reasons. First, neither the attack signal nor the BCI signal individually triggers any alarm. Second, the attack frequency may be indistinguishable from normal RF traffic in the environment. Third, the harmful neural-frequency signal is generated inside the patient's own tissue, not in the signal chain. No signal-level metric can detect intermodulation from the BCI data stream alone.

Consumer devices are especially vulnerable. A Muse headband using BLE at 2.4 GHz has no EM shielding (plastic housing, consumer-grade). An attacker's phone transmitting at 2.4 GHz plus or minus 10 Hz via software-defined radio can produce alpha/theta beat frequencies in nonlinear scalp tissue. QI_consumer has no mechanism to detect this without EM environment awareness.

For implanted devices, the risk is higher. A deep brain stimulator at 130 Hz can be weaponized by an external signal at 126 Hz to produce a 4 Hz theta disruption in the thalamus. Both frequencies are within the normal DBS operating range.

## 7. Neural Sensory Protocol (NSP)

### 7.1 Motivation: The Implant Lifetime Vulnerability

Neuralink's N1 is an implant designed to remain in a patient's brain for 10 to 20 years. NIST estimates cryptographically relevant quantum computers by 2030 to 2035. Current BCI wireless (BLE) uses ECDH for key exchange, which is broken by Shor's algorithm [48]. Adversaries can record encrypted BCI traffic today and store it. When quantum computers arrive, they decrypt everything retroactively. Neural data is permanently sensitive: unlike a credit card number, brain patterns cannot be reissued.

This is the harvest-now-decrypt-later (HNDL) threat [37]. It is the explicit threat model behind NIST's entire post-quantum cryptography program. For financial data, HNDL is a nuisance. For neural data, it is catastrophic.

| Crypto Component | Quantum-Safe? | Used in BCI Wireless? |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| AES-128/256 (symmetric encryption) | Yes (Grover halves key; AES-256 remains practically secure) | Yes (BLE) |
| HMAC-SHA-256 (integrity) | Yes | Some |
| ECDH (key exchange) | **No, broken by Shor's** | **Yes (BLE standard)** |
| ECDSA (digital signatures) | **No, broken by Shor's** | **Yes (device authentication)** |

The encryption itself is adequate. The key exchange is the vulnerability.

### 7.2 NSP Protocol Architecture

NSP wraps existing BCI data frames with five defense layers:

**Layer 1: EM Environment Monitoring**

Passive or active electromagnetic environment sensing at the I0 boundary. Detects unauthorized RF signals, monitors for temporal interference and intermodulation attack signatures, and logs all detected EM events for the security audit trail. For consumer devices, this is implemented as BLE passive scanning between connection intervals (firmware-level, no additional hardware). For implanted devices, this is the resonance shield (Section 7.5).

**Layer 2: Signal Physics (QI Score)**

```
QI(b, t) = e^(-S(b, t))
```

The unified QI equation applied per band per time window. Checks whether the neural signal is physically legitimate. Works even if cryptographic layers are compromised.

**Layer 3: Post-Quantum Key Exchange (ML-KEM)**

ML-KEM (Kyber), FIPS 203, replaces ECDH [37]. Lattice-based key encapsulation. Session keys are exchanged using a mechanism resistant to both classical and quantum adversaries. Combined with classical ECDH in a hybrid construction for defense in depth during the transition period.

**Layer 4: Post-Quantum Authentication (ML-DSA)**

ML-DSA (Dilithium), FIPS 204, replaces ECDSA [37]. Every NSP frame is signed with a lattice-based digital signature. Authenticates both the device and the data stream against quantum-capable adversaries.

**Layer 5: Payload Encryption (AES-256-GCM)**

AES-256-GCM provides authenticated encryption of the neural data payload. AES-256 remains quantum-resistant under Grover's algorithm (effective key length reduced to 128 bits, which is still practically unbreakable) [37]. GCM mode provides both confidentiality and integrity in a single pass.

### 7.3 Two-Layer Defense Logic

The five protocol layers implement a fundamental two-layer defense:

| Attack | Physics layer catches? | Crypto layer catches? |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Signal injection (physically impossible f*L) | **Yes** | No |
| Replay attack (real signal replayed) | No | **Yes** (nonce/sequence) |
| Man-in-the-middle | No | **Yes** (authentication) |
| Harvest-now-decrypt-later | No | **Yes** (PQC key exchange) |
| Adversarial crafted signal | No | No (needs ML/TTT layer) |

Physics and cryptography cover each other's blind spots. Physics catches attacks that are physically impossible regardless of authentication status. Cryptography catches attacks that are physically plausible but unauthorized.

### 7.4 Device Tiers

NSP scales across three device classes:

| Device Class | Channels | NSP Layers Active | Key Threat |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Consumer headband (Muse, Emotiv) | 4 to 16 | Layers 2, 5 (QI_consumer + AES) | Direct injection via BLE |
| Clinical EEG / research | 32 to 256 | Layers 2, 3, 4, 5 (QI + PQC + AES) | Replay, slow drift |
| Implanted BCI / DBS | 16 to 1024 | All five layers | Intermodulation, nation-state HNDL |

Consumer devices omit PQC layers due to computational constraints (ML-KEM and ML-DSA add latency and power consumption). Clinical devices adopt PQC for data-at-rest and data-in-transit protection. Implanted devices require the full stack because their 10 to 20 year lifespan overlaps with the estimated arrival of cryptographically relevant quantum computers.

### 7.5 The Resonance Shield

The resonance shield is a proposed hardware defense mechanism at the I0 boundary. It operates on the principle of destructive interference: an incoming wave at frequency f and phase phi is cancelled by an equal-amplitude wave at frequency f and phase phi + pi. This is the same principle as active noise-canceling headphones (acoustic), radar jamming (RF), and adaptive optics (optical).

Requirements:
1. **Detection.** Sensor array measuring incoming EM field (frequency, phase, amplitude).
2. **Computation.** Real-time calculation of the cancellation signal. At 40 Hz, the wave period is 25 ms; response must be under 5 ms.
3. **Emission.** Antenna array broadcasting the cancellation field.
4. **Whitelist.** Authorized frequencies (therapeutic stimulation, medical imaging) pass through; unauthorized frequencies are cancelled.

**Dual-use: MRI Compatibility.** Current BCI patients often cannot receive MRI scans because strong magnetic fields (1.5T or 3T static, 64 to 128 MHz RF pulses, kHz-rate gradient switching) can heat implant electrodes, induce currents, and corrupt the BCI. A resonance shield designed to protect against adversarial EM fields would also solve MRI compatibility by cancelling harmful MRI-induced fields at the electrode while allowing diagnostic imaging to proceed. This makes the resonance shield not only a security feature but a clinical necessity that expands BCI adoption by removing the MRI exclusion barrier.

**Status:** The resonance shield is a proposed concept. No prototype exists. Feasibility depends on miniaturizing active EM cancellation hardware to implant-compatible dimensions and power budgets. This is an engineering challenge, not a physics barrier.

### 7.6 Key Lifecycle and Power Budget

**Key lifecycle.** ML-KEM session keys are ephemeral, rotated per connection or per time interval (configurable). Long-term identity keys (ML-DSA) are provisioned at device manufacturing and stored in tamper-resistant hardware. Key revocation uses certificate revocation lists distributed via the clinical backend. For implanted devices that cannot receive firmware updates, key rotation is performed via the wireless link using the existing ML-KEM channel.

**Power budget.** Neuralink N1 consumes 24.7 mW total. NSP's cryptographic overhead must fit within a fraction of this budget. AES-256-GCM is hardware-accelerated in most modern SoCs (sub-milliwatt at BCI data rates). ML-KEM key encapsulation requires approximately 0.5 ms computation per operation on ARM Cortex-M4 class processors, with energy cost under 100 microjoules per key exchange. ML-DSA signature generation is more expensive (approximately 2 ms, approximately 400 microjoules). At one key exchange per minute and one signature per data frame (approximately 50 Hz), the PQC overhead is approximately 0.5 mW, or approximately 2% of N1's total power budget. These are estimates based on published benchmarks of liboqs (Open Quantum Safe) on constrained hardware. Actual overhead on BCI-specific SoCs requires measurement.

### 7.7 No-Cloning as Foundation

The no-cloning theorem (Wootters and Zurek, 1982 [24]) is not a hypothesis. It is a mathematical theorem, proven from the linearity of unitary quantum operations. Its status in the hierarchy of scientific certainty is the highest possible: mathematically proven from axioms. As long as quantum mechanics is correct, no-cloning is inviolable.

For BCI security, no-cloning applies at I0 (the electrode-tissue interface). If quantum coherence persists at the boundary, the quantum neural state cannot be perfectly copied. An attacker can record the classical measurement output (voltages), but this classical copy cannot reconstruct the full quantum state that produced it. The measurement is lossy by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle [1].

No-cloning does not protect the classical data stream (S1 through S3). Once quantum states are measured and converted to classical bits, those bits are freely copyable. This is where PQC is essential. No-cloning protects I0. PQC protects S1 through S3. Together they provide defense-in-depth across the full BCI stack.

## 8. The Black Hole Security Principle

### 8.1 Origin

While designing the NSP compression pipeline, an observation emerged: SPHINCS+ signatures cannot be compressed because they are indistinguishable from random data (Shannon's source coding theorem). This property, that well-encrypted data is indistinguishable from random noise, is shared by Hawking radiation from a black hole. The question arose whether the mathematical structures underlying black hole information scrambling share formal properties with the information-theoretic guarantees of modern encryption.

### 8.2 Four Proposed Analogies

We describe four structural parallels between black hole physics and NSP security. Following independent peer review by Gemini (Section 8.3), we present these explicitly as conceptual analogies, not formal equivalences.

**Analogy 1: Encryption as Scrambling.** Sekino and Susskind (2008) proved that black holes are the fastest information scramblers in nature, achieving full delocalization of information in t* proportional to ln(S) operations [62]. AES-256 achieves full diffusion of plaintext across ciphertext in 14 rounds, which scales as O(ln(N)) for N-bit blocks. Both processes spread information across all degrees of freedom so that no local measurement recovers the original. The structural similarity is real, but the underlying physics is fundamentally different: black hole scrambling is quantum many-body dynamics governed by a Hamiltonian, while AES is a classical deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-size blocks.

**Analogy 2: I0 as Holographic Boundary.** The holographic principle ('t Hooft 1993, Susskind 1995) states that all information about a volume is encoded on its boundary surface [65, 66]. BCIs already work this way operationally: EEG and ECoG measure surface potentials, and source localization algorithms reconstruct 3D brain activity from 2D surface measurements. This is holographic reconstruction in practice. The Bekenstein bound provides a theoretical information limit at I0 [67]. However, the holographic principle is a conjecture in quantum gravity operating at Planck-scale physics. Applying it to a macroscopic electrode surface 30 orders of magnitude larger than the Planck length is not formally justified. The operational analogy is useful; the formal equivalence is not established.

**Analogy 3: Key Exchange as Page Curve.** Page (1993) showed that the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation follows a characteristic curve: entropy increases (radiation looks thermal) until the Page time, then decreases (correlations emerge and information becomes recoverable) [68]. NSP key exchange has a structurally similar information profile: without the session key, accumulated ciphertext reveals nothing (H(M|C) = H(M), semantic security); with the key, all frames decode (H(M|C,K) = 0). The key is the analog of the Page time. The visual similarity of the information curves is genuine, but the underlying mechanisms are different: the Page curve describes quantum entanglement entropy in a gravitational system, while key exchange is a classical-computational process.

**Analogy 4: Semantic Security as Thermal Spectrum.** Hawking radiation has a blackbody (maximum entropy) spectrum. Each quantum is indistinguishable from thermal noise. The semantic security property of AES-256-GCM states that |Pr[D(C)=1] - Pr[D(U)=1]| < epsilon for any polynomial-time distinguisher D. Both statements say that output is indistinguishable from maximum-entropy noise. The parallel is structural, not physical. Semantic security is a computational indistinguishability property (against bounded adversaries). The thermal spectrum is a physical property of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The word "identical" would be incorrect.

### 8.3 Gemini Peer Review and Honest Assessment

These four analogies were submitted to independent peer review via Gemini. The review [GEMINI-REVIEW-BLACKHOLE.md] concluded:

> "The 'Black Hole Security Principle' is a compelling narrative, but it is not a rigorous security framework. It derives its claims from analogies that break down under formal analysis."

The review ranked the weaknesses as follows:

1. **Derivation 2 (Holographic boundary):** Most flagrantly incorrect application. The holographic principle operates at Planck-scale physics; applying it to a macroscopic electrode is unjustified.
2. **Derivation 1 (Scrambling):** Category error between quantum many-body dynamics and classical algorithmic operations.
3. **Derivation 4 (Semantic security = thermal):** Confuses computational indistinguishability with physical thermal properties.
4. **Derivation 3 (Page curve):** Superficial visual similarity between curves driven by different mechanisms.

We accept this critique. The Black Hole Security Principle is a conceptual analogy, useful for scientific communication and for highlighting the information-theoretic properties that NSP achieves. It is not a formal security proof. NSP's actual security rests on the proven properties of its cryptographic primitives: the semantic security of AES-256-GCM, the IND-CCA2 security of ML-KEM under the Module-LWE assumption, and the EUF-CMA security of ML-DSA under the Module-SIS assumption. These are formal, reducible guarantees that do not require physics analogies.

### 8.4 What the Analogy Is Good For

Despite its limitations, the black hole analogy has value in three ways.

First, it provides an intuitive narrative for explaining NSP's information-theoretic properties to audiences across physics, engineering, and policy. "Neural data crosses the encryption horizon and becomes indistinguishable from thermal noise" communicates the security guarantee in one sentence.

Second, the structural parallels are not entirely coincidental. Both black hole scrambling and strong encryption share a common mathematical ancestor: maximization of entropy subject to constraints. The Boltzmann factor e^(-E/kT) appears in thermal physics, in the QI equation, and in the analysis of encryption security margins. This shared mathematical structure is worth investigating, even if the physics is different.

Third, the supporting literature is real. Dvali (2018) showed that quantum neural networks with gravity-like synaptic connections exhibit Bekenstein-Hawking area law entropy [69]. Tozzi et al. (2023) treated the brain connectome as 4D spacetime curved by brain activity, invoking the holographic principle [70]. Pastawski et al. (2015) demonstrated that holographic emergence of spacetime works exactly like a quantum error-correcting code [71]. These papers do not validate the Black Hole Security Principle as a formal security framework, but they establish that the mathematical connections between neural information processing and gravitational information theory are an active area of legitimate research.

## 9. Falsifiability

A framework that cannot be disproven is not science. QIF is designed to be empirically testable. The following findings would weaken or falsify specific components.

### 9.1 Universal Fast Decoherence at Neural Interfaces

If decoherence at the electrode-tissue boundary is confirmed to be universally below picosecond timescales (tau_D < 10^-12 s) across all measurement conditions, the quantum terms (Qi_hat, Qe_hat, Qt_hat gating via GammaD for the first two) become negligible. The framework degrades gracefully to a classical-only model: QI(t) approximately equals e^(-Sc). This does not break QIF. It reduces it to its classical foundation, which retains independent value as a 7-band hourglass BCI security architecture with a physics-based composite anomaly score.

### 9.2 Ion Channel Tunneling Profiles Are Not Individually Unique

If single-channel patch clamp studies combined with quantum state tomography reveal that tunneling coefficients T(E) do not vary significantly between individuals (inter-subject variation within measurement noise), the quantum biometric hypothesis is invalid. The tunneling term Qt_hat would still function as a threat model (tunneling is a vulnerability regardless of whether profiles are unique), but the biometric application would be falsified.

### 9.3 No Measurable Quantum Effects at the Electrode-Tissue Interface

If quantum state tomography at the BCI junction consistently shows fully classical statistics (density matrix indistinguishable from classical mixture for all practical measurements), then quantum corrections at I0 and N1 through N3 are zero. The framework's novel quantum contributions would be falsified. The classical architecture, the attack coupling taxonomy, and the NSP protocol retain independent value.

### 9.4 Zeno Effect Impossible at Any Plausible BCI Sampling Rate

If theoretical or experimental work demonstrates that Zeno stabilization requires measurement rates exceeding 10^9 Hz at the electrode interface (far beyond any foreseeable BCI technology), the conditional Zeno-BCI hypothesis is removed as a contribution. This hypothesis is already framed as conditional on decoherence timescale (tau_D >= 1 ms, Fisher-like timescales). At Tegmark's timescale (10^-13 s), the Zeno contribution is negligible.

### 9.5 Davydov Soliton Attacks Cannot Be Artificially Generated

If in vitro experiments show that terahertz radiation cannot generate Davydov solitons in SNARE protein complexes, or that such solitons cannot influence vesicle release, the Davydov soliton attack vector (Mechanism E variant) is falsified as a practical threat. The other four attack coupling mechanisms remain valid independently.

### 9.6 Graceful Degradation

QIF's parameterized design means that most falsification scenarios reduce the framework's scope rather than destroying it. If all quantum terms are zero, QIF becomes a classical 7-band hourglass BCI security model with a physics-based composite anomaly score, post-quantum encrypted communications, and a five-mechanism attack coupling taxonomy. The worst case for QIF is the current assumption of most BCI security researchers: that quantum effects do not matter. The framework is designed so that this assumption is testable, not axiomatic.

---

## 10. Discussion

### 10.1 What QIF Is

QIF is a proposed security architecture for brain-computer interfaces that unifies classical signal integrity metrics with quantum-aware anomaly detection in a single mathematical framework. It provides:

- A 7-band hourglass model derived from neural and silicon physics, not networking analogy
- A unified equation QI(b,t) = e^(-S(b,t)) with clear Boltzmann-factor structure
- A five-mechanism attack coupling taxonomy for cross-domain BCI threats
- A post-quantum communication protocol (NSP) for BCI data
- Explicit falsifiability conditions
- Honest boundaries on what it can and cannot detect

### 10.2 What QIF Is Not

QIF is not experimentally validated. The equations are theoretical. No QI score has been computed from real BCI data under attack conditions. The scaling coefficients (w1 through w4 for classical terms, psi1 through psi3 for quantum terms) have not been calibrated. Without calibration, the framework produces relative comparisons (this signal is more anomalous than that one) but not absolute security scores.

QIF does not model consciousness. The N3 band (Integrative Association) maps to measurable, security-relevant properties of cognition. QIF does not claim that these properties constitute or explain conscious experience.

QIF does not prove that quantum effects matter for BCI security. The quantum terms are hypothesized contributions. Their magnitude depends on the decoherence timescale at the electrode-tissue interface, which remains uncertain by several orders of magnitude. If tau_D is at Tegmark's estimate (10^-13 s), the quantum terms are negligible and QIF reduces to its classical core.

QIF does not replace formal cryptographic security proofs. The Black Hole Security Principle (Section 8) is a conceptual analogy. NSP's security rests on the proven properties of AES-256-GCM, ML-KEM, and ML-DSA, not on analogies to gravitational physics.

### 10.3 Calibration Requirements

The calibration process must proceed in phases because different terms require different instrumentation.

**Phase 1: Classical Baseline (w1, w2, w3, w4).** Deploy QIF's classical pipeline on a standard BCI testbed. Run known attack scenarios (signal injection, replay, noise flooding) at known intensities. Set weights such that the classical QI score correctly classifies known attacks with at least 95% accuracy on the test suite.

**Phase 2: Quantum Effect Measurement (psi1, psi3, tau_D).** Requires quantum state tomography at the electrode-tissue interface. Measure decoherence time tau_D directly. Compute Qi_hat from Robertson-Schrodinger relation using measured density matrices. Set psi1 and psi3 such that quantum contributions are scaled appropriately relative to classical terms.

**Phase 3: Tunneling (psi2).** Measure tunneling coefficients T across multiple ion channel types at the electrode interface. Simulate tunneling-based attacks at varying intensities. Set psi2 such that Qt_hat correctly reflects the measured vulnerability.

**Validation criterion.** After calibration, the QI equation must agree with independent anomaly detection methods (ML-based, expert assessment) on security classification for at least 90% of test scenarios.

### 10.4 Limitations Summary

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| No experimental validation | Equations are theoretical | Testable predictions provided (Section 9) |
| Scaling coefficients uncalibrated | Cannot compute absolute QI values | Framework valid for relative comparisons |
| Decoherence time disputed | Quantum terms may be negligible | Tunable tau_D; graceful degradation |
| Biological entanglement unproven | Qe_hat may require artificial sources | Framework works either way |
| Quantum state tomography expensive | Quantum terms hard to measure | Classical terms provide immediate value |
| Resonance shield is concept only | Layer 1 defense unimplemented | Defines the engineering target |
| No tampered BCI dataset exists | Cannot validate against real attacks | Synthetic attack generation proposed |
| Three classical terms have different natural scales | Weighting may need normalization | Open calibration question |

### 10.5 Energy Bounds

Landauer's Principle [61] establishes the fundamental thermodynamic cost of information processing: E_min = kT * ln(2) per bit erasure. At body temperature (310 K), this is approximately 2.97 * 10^-21 joules per bit. This is relevant to BCI security in two ways. First, it sets a physics-derived lower bound on the energy required for any computation, including attack signal generation and quantum state measurement. Second, it replaces Moore's Law (which is an empirical trend, not a physical law) as the correct reference for energy scaling arguments in the framework. Any claim about computational energy limits in QIF must reference Landauer, not Moore.

---

## 11. Future Work

### 11.1 Immediate Priorities

1. **Phase 1 Validation.** Implement the classical QI equation (Sc only) against PhysioNet EEGBCI dataset (109 subjects) and BrainFlow live data. Generate synthetic attacks. Report which attacks the equation catches and which it misses. Publish results regardless of outcome.

2. **Synthetic Attack Dataset.** No public "tampered BCI" dataset exists. Creating one, with documented attack types mapped to the five coupling mechanisms, would itself be a publishable contribution.

3. **Consumer Dspec Validation.** Test the spectral consistency proxy (Dspec) on consumer-grade EEG data (Muse, Emotiv). Determine whether Dspec provides meaningful anomaly detection with 4 to 16 channels.

### 11.2 Medium-Term Research

4. **H_interface Formulation.** Write down the Hamiltonian H_total = H_neuron + H_electrode + H_interface + H_environment for a specific BCI system (e.g., platinum electrode in cortical tissue). This would derive all quantum terms from a single equation and reduce free parameters.

5. **NSP Reference Implementation.** Build the protocol in Python (OpenBCI ecosystem) and C (firmware-embeddable), integrating liboqs (Open Quantum Safe project) for ML-KEM and ML-DSA.

6. **Resonance Shield Feasibility Study.** Determine whether active EM cancellation can be miniaturized to implant-compatible dimensions and power budgets. Survey existing literature on MRI-compatible active shielding for implantable devices.

7. **Intermodulation Detection Research.** The gap identified in Section 6.4 (intermodulation attacks are undetectable from signal data alone) needs a solution. Options include passive RF fingerprinting at the device firmware level and low-cost passive shielding (ferrite collars).

### 11.3 Long-Term Goals

8. **Quantum State Tomography at the BCI Interface.** Measure the actual decoherence time tau_D at a BCI electrode-tissue junction. This single measurement would resolve the framework's central unknown and constrain all quantum terms simultaneously.

9. **Tunneling Biometric Feasibility.** Determine via single-channel patch clamp studies whether ion channel tunneling profiles vary significantly between individuals.

10. **Zeno-BCI Experimental Test.** Vary BCI sampling rate from 100 Hz to 20 kHz and measure coherence time at the electrode interface. If tau_D >= 1 ms, the Zeno effect should manifest as increased coherence at higher sampling rates.

11. **v4.0 Architecture Expansion.** Derivation Log entries 33 and 34 propose expanding the neural domain from 3 bands to 7 bands (N1 Spinal Cord through N7 Neocortex) with a 7-1-3 hourglass geometry. This expansion provides severity-aware, anatomically specific security scoring. Validation and adoption of v4.0 is deferred pending additional peer review.
