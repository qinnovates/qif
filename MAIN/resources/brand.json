### IMPORTANT NOTE: This JSON contains env. variables that I referenced on the main ONI landing page (https://qikevinl.github.io/ONI/) and within the python packages. ###
### The purpose to be agile in the early development phase for any modifications to the brand details change, it will reflect elsewhere dynamically. 
### For secure measures, I've configured input validation and other guardrails to prevent abuse and misuse.
### All PR requests for this file will require my explicit approval for that purpose.
