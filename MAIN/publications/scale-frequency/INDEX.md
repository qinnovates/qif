## Summary

Scale-Frequency analysis reveals a fundamental invariant in neural information processing: the product of spatial scale and temporal frequency remains approximately constant across biological layers. This relationship (f × S ≈ 10⁶ m·Hz) emerges from the physics of neural computation and has direct implications for BCI design.

At molecular scales (L1), processes operate at microsecond timescales with frequencies in the MHz range. At whole-brain scales (L6), oscillations occur at Hz frequencies but coordinate across centimeters of tissue. The scale-frequency constant provides a unifying principle for understanding how information compresses and expands as it traverses the neural hierarchy.

For BCI security, this invariant establishes expectations for legitimate signals at each layer — deviations from the expected scale-frequency relationship can indicate signal manipulation or injection attempts.
