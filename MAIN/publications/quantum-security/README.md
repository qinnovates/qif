## Summary

Quantum Security examines the emerging threat landscape where quantum computers pose existential risks to classical cryptography while simultaneously introducing new attack surfaces against quantum systems themselves.

The analysis debunks science fiction scenarios (quantum entanglement enabling "anywhere in the universe" attacks) while highlighting real, mathematically-proven threats: Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) attacks where nation-states collect encrypted data today for future decryption, Shor's algorithm breaking RSA/ECC encryption, and physical attacks exploiting quantum hardware fragility.

A key connection to the ONI Framework is the Scale-Frequency Invariant (f × S ≈ k) applied to quantum coherence—demonstrating how the "observer effect" functions as a denial-of-service attack vector against quantum computation, collapsing global quantum states into local noise.

The article proposes a three-category threat taxonomy: attacks BY quantum computers (on classical systems), attacks ON quantum computers (hardware/software vulnerabilities), and attacks on the classical-quantum INTERFACE.
