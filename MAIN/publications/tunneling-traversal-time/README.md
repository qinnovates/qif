## Summary

Tunneling Traversal Time (TTT) explores how quantum mechanical phenomena—specifically the measurable duration particles spend inside potential barriers—could serve as security primitives for brain-computer interfaces.

Building on the 2025 Nobel Prize recognition of macroscopic quantum tunneling and the POSTECH discovery of Under-the-Barrier Recollision (UBR), this research proposes the **Liminal Phase Security Model**: the state during barrier traversal is inherently self-monitoring, where any eavesdropping attempt disturbs the quantum system in detectable ways.

The framework extends the Scale-Frequency Invariant (`f × S ≈ k`) from neural signaling to quantum-classical interfaces, identifying three candidate security mechanisms: tunneling time signatures, UBR detection, and Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs). While TTT signatures and UBR detection remain technologically distant, QPUFs represent a near-term (3-5 year) opportunity for quantum-enhanced BCI authentication.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Tunneling Traversal Time (TTT) | Duration a particle spends traversing a potential barrier during quantum tunneling |
| Liminal Phase | The state during barrier traversal—neither initial nor final state—where the system exists as a probability distribution |
| Under-the-Barrier Recollision (UBR) | POSTECH 2025 discovery that electrons collide with nuclei inside the barrier during tunneling |
| Quantum Physical Unclonable Function (QPUF) | Security primitive exploiting quantum effects for device authentication; guaranteed unclonable by no-cloning theorem |
| Attoclock | Measurement technique using strong laser fields to extract tunneling time from electron emission angles |
| `f × S ≈ k` (Quantum Application) | Scale-Frequency Invariant applied to quantum coherence—probing frequency increases cause coherence collapse |

## Threat Model

| Category | Description | TTT Defense |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Passive Eavesdropping | Intercepting neural signals | UBR detection (any observation alters collision dynamics) |
| Active Injection | Inserting malicious signals | TTT signatures (wrong timing detectable) |
| Physical Tampering | Modifying electrode interface | QPUF authentication (tampering invalidates quantum fingerprint) |
| Side-Channel | Exploiting timing/power emissions | Partial—timing side-channels remain a concern |

## Technology Readiness

| Mechanism | Readiness | Timeline | Key Gap |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| QPUF Authentication | **High** | 3-5 years | Biocompatibility testing |
| TTT Signatures | Low | 10-15 years | Attosecond timing at bio-temp |
| UBR Detection | Very Low | Unknown | Requires laser-free detection |
