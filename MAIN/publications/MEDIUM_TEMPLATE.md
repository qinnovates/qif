## Writing Guidelines

### Tone
- **Conversational but authoritative**
- Write like you're explaining to a smart friend
- Use "you" and "we" to create connection
- Avoid jargon without explanation

### Structure
- **Short paragraphs:** 2-3 sentences max
- **Frequent headers:** Every 3-4 paragraphs
- **White space:** Use `• • •` or `---` for section breaks
- **Scannable:** Readers should get the gist by skimming headers

### Hooks
Good opening patterns:
- "Here's something that should keep you up at night..."
- "[Surprising statistic or fact]"
- "What if I told you..."
- "In [year], [something will happen]. Are we ready?"

### Length
- **Target:** 1,500-4,000 words (5-15 minute read)
- **Sweet spot:** 2,000-2,500 words

### Tags
Choose 5 tags that:
- Describe the main topic (e.g., `neuroscience`, `cybersecurity`)
- Capture the angle (e.g., `future`, `security`)
- Include relevant technology (e.g., `neuralink`, `ai`)
