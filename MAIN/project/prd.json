      "description": "Research and develop devices/methods that can monitor and protect neural systems at layers that current BCI electrodes cannot access. Electrodes can only interact at the millisecond-scale electrical signaling layer—they cannot detect or address molecular substrate attacks (nutritional depletion, enzymatic inhibition, receptor antagonism) or faster processes (femtosecond enzyme kinetics, nanosecond ion channel gating).",
      "rationale": "Current BCIs have a fundamental blind spot: they monitor electrical activity but cannot detect biochemical attacks. An attacker could deplete iron (blocking dopamine synthesis), antagonize receptors (blocking neurotransmitter effects), or poison enzymes (halting production)—and the BCI would only see 'reduced signaling' without understanding the cause. This is a critical gap in neural security.",
