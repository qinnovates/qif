---

## Backlog (Prioritized)

### [P3] brainflow-integration
- **Description:** Add BrainFlow integration for real-time hardware support
- **Exit Condition:** `tara/data/brainflow_adapter.py` exists with OpenBCI Cyton support
- **Risk:** Low (nice-to-have feature)
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Estimate:** Medium effort

### [P2] moabb-coherence-benchmark
- **Description:** Benchmark Cₛ accuracy against real MOABB EEG data
- **Exit Condition:** Benchmark results with precision, recall, F1 for attack detection
- **Risk:** Medium (validation critical for credibility)
- **Dependencies:** moabb-adapter-implementation ✓
- **Estimate:** Medium effort

### [P2] moabb-attack-scenarios
- **Description:** Create real-signal attack scenarios using MOABB data
- **Exit Condition:** 3+ attack scenarios tested: spike injection, frequency hijacking, noise masking
- **Risk:** Medium (demonstrates practical applicability)
- **Dependencies:** moabb-adapter-implementation ✓
- **Estimate:** Medium effort

### [P2] bci-macro-to-micro-visualization
- **Description:** Create animated Blender visualization showing macro-to-micro BCI interface (brain → region → neurons → synapses → neurotransmitters)
- **Exit Condition:** Blender animation file with seamless zoom from whole brain to molecular level
- **Risk:** Medium (engineering challenge to stitch scales)
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Estimate:** Large effort
- **Notes:**
  - Goal: Visualize how BCIs interface with the brain, where electrodes sit, which regions
  - Current tech limitation: BCIs use electrical stimulation, cannot directly stimulate neurotransmitters (VERIFIED)
  - Resources found:
    - brain2printAI: AI tool to convert MRI → 3D printable brain models (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-00014-5)
    - Free brain STL: https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/human-anatomy/brain-59cffe18-e669-4dae-a588-1f82cee6fd45
    - Molecular Nodes addon for Blender (neurotransmitter/molecule rendering)
    - PDB database for receptor structures (e.g., dopamine D2 receptor: 6CM4)
  - Approach: Programmatically stitch components across scales for seamless animation
  - Related: Research doc `brain-anatomy/Research-BCI_Mouse_Movement.md`

## To Do (Ready to Start)

### [P2] changelog-creation
- **Description:** Create CHANGELOG.md at repository root
- **Exit Condition:** `CHANGELOG.md` exists with semantic versioning
- **Risk:** Low
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Estimate:** Small effort

### [P1] python-code-sync
- **Description:** Verify `oni-framework/oni/layers.py` matches corrected ONI model
- **Exit Condition:** Layer definitions in Python match corrected ONI (L1-L7 OSI, L8-L14 Neural)
- **Risk:** High (code-docs mismatch causes confusion)
- **Dependencies:** oni-layer-correction ✓
- **Estimate:** Small effort

### [P2] moabb-attack-scenarios
- **Description:** Create real-signal attack scenarios using MOABB data
- **Exit Condition:** 3+ attack scenarios tested with real EEG
- **Risk:** Medium
- **Dependencies:** moabb-adapter-implementation ✓
- **Estimate:** Medium effort

## How to Use This Board

### Moving Tasks

1. **Backlog → To Do:** When dependencies resolved and priority assigned
2. **To Do → In Progress:** When starting work (respect WIP limits)
3. **In Progress → In Review:** When work complete, needs verification
4. **In Review → Done:** When exit condition verified

### Syncing with prd.json

After moving tasks:
1. Update task `status` in `prd.json`
2. Add `completed_at` date for Done tasks
3. Add `learnings` for completed tasks
4. Update `metrics` section totals

### Adding New Tasks

1. Add to `prd.json` with unique ID
2. Add to Backlog section here
3. Assign priority (P0-P3)
4. Define exit condition
5. Identify dependencies

*Synced with: `prd.json` v0.5.0*
*Board Version: 1.1*
