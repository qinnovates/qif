# Academic Research Landscape: BCI Security & Neuroethics

> A comprehensive mapping of foundational research, key institutions, and notable researchers whose work aligns with and informs the ONI Framework.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-24
**Purpose:** Academic positioning, collaboration opportunities, graduate program alignment

---

## Executive Summary

The ONI Framework sits at the intersection of three academic domains:
1. **BCI Security** — Technical protection of neural device communications
2. **Neuroethics** — Philosophical and policy frameworks for neural technology
3. **Neural Engineering** — Development of brain-machine interfaces

This document maps the research landscape to:
- Acknowledge foundational work that ONI builds upon
- Identify synergies between ONI's contributions and ongoing research
- Position ONI for academic collaboration and graduate study opportunities

2. **Personal Identity** — Technology cannot alter sense of self
3. **Free Will** — Decisions without neurotechnological manipulation
4. **Equal Access** — Fair access to cognitive enhancement
5. **Protection from Bias** — No discrimination based on brain data

**Legislative Impact:**
- Chile constitutional reform (2021) — First nation to protect "mental integrity"
- Colorado neurorights law (2024)
- California "Neurorights Bill" (2024) — Senate unanimous approval
- U.S. MIND Act (2025) — First federal neurotechnology governance bill

**How ONI Aligns:**
- L14 (Identity) protects personal identity

|-------------------------|-------------------|
| No unified security model across BCI types | 14-layer model applicable to invasive, non-invasive, and hybrid BCIs |
| Privacy concepts remain theoretical | `BCIAnonymizer` provides executable implementation |
| No standard threat taxonomy | Kohno CIA model + attack pattern library in TARA |
| Layer-by-layer attack surface undefined | ONI explicitly maps attacks to layers L1-L14 |
| Coherence/integrity unmeasured | Cₛ metric provides quantifiable signal trust |
| Neurorights lack technical enforcement | Framework translates rights to technical controls |
