## Executive Summary

The ONI Framework sits at the intersection of three academic domains:
1. **BCI Security** — Technical protection of neural device communications
2. **Neuroethics** — Philosophical and policy frameworks for neural technology
3. **Neural Engineering** — Development of brain-machine interfaces

This document maps the research landscape to:
- Acknowledge foundational work that ONI builds upon
