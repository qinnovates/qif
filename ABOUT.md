# 👋 Hello, World

I'm an independent security researcher with an incurable curiosity for how complex systems break—and how to design them at scale so they don't. My passions emerge at an entangled vector space in time: cybersecurity, science, and technology.

My obsession with "how things work" didn't start in a lab; it culminated in middle school, the moment we got our first family Packard Bell computer. I spent those early years playing "Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing" which led to me discovering PHPBB forums and ultimately learning how to build my own. By 11, I had built my first website—navigating the vast, unlimited knowledge of the early internet to teach myself how. I created a community where I could share what my undeveloped mind felt was uniquely sophisticated, yet simple to reproduce Photoshop tutorials for my 3,000+ registered members. Imagine having your tutorials seen and published by the literal top website for photoshop tutorials in existence during the early 2000s (pre-DeviantArt days). Little did I know then, that this wasn't what most of my peers were doing, and this the was pivotal moment.

That experience shaped me. I was inspired by strangers on the internet who freely shared their knowledge, helping a curious kid figure things out (thank you, Aaron of AGFX). I want to do the same. The ONI Framework is my way of giving back—a framework I hope can inspire and help others in the industry who share the same interests and passion as me.

Maybe it was because I was always so curious about how the internet works, the community we each can derive, or maybe because I really just wanted to push off on doing my summer school homework. Frankly, the foundation of my work ethic and passion goes deeper than a screen.

I grew up watching my father, an autodidactic electrical engineer from China, navigate a world that didn't recognize his brilliance. Despite his deep technical knowledge, he had no formal college education and immigrated here to work as a dishwasher in a restaurant. He did this to help pay for his father's woodworking factory—a dream that eventually burned to the ground. He did this so I can build my American Dream.

That fire left his parents ready to sell our ancestral home. This wasn't just a house; it was a single roof in a small fishing village that sheltered three generations and three separate families—including my aunts and uncles—all living together at once. Watching my father engineer a life for us out of nothing under that kind of pressure, balancing the grit of manual labor with the precision of a self-taught mind, is where I learned what Grit truly is. To me, engineering isn't just a career; it's a survival mechanism used to turn uncertainty into something measurable and actionable.

Over the last ~15 years, I've worked across Biotech, high-scale consumer tech, publishing, and institutional finance—spanning Private Equity and high-volume mortgage lending. I've specialized in stepping into "void environments"—places where data exists at an astronomical scale, but the systems to interpret and secure it don't. I've spent my career wiring together disparate data sources and building enterprise security systems that turn raw telemetry into something my teams and I can actually reason about. Transforming the entropy amongst the unknowns into actionable results.

The goal was never just visibility—it was methodical anticipation, planning, and execution.

Whether I was protecting the digital identities of millions in consumer tech or securing high-value assets during complex financial acquisitions, the challenge was always the same: thinking simultaneously like an engineer, an adversary, and a human operator. By normalizing data and codifying expected signal behavior, we built systems capable of identifying attacks before they fully materialized, preserving signal efficacy across large-scale, multi-layered data streams.

"The ONI Project" is the culmination of that mindset. It is a living research effort designed to develop rigorous, testable frameworks to help protect the "crown jewels" of what makes us human. The source of our unique cognitive fingerprints as we enter the age of brain–computer interfaces.
