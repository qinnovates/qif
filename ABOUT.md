# About the Author

I'm an independent security researcher with an incurable curiosity for how complex systems break—and how to design them so they don't.

## The Origin

My obsession with "how things work" started in middle school, the moment we got our first Packard Bell computer. By 11, I had built my first website—teaching myself through the vast, unlimited knowledge of the early internet. I created a community of 3,000+ members where I shared Photoshop tutorials, creating abstract art when the internet first became a thing, inspired by strangers who freely shared their knowledge with a curious kid asking too many questions.

That experience shaped me. Mindloft is how I pay it forward—a vision I hope can inspire others in this emerging field.

## The Foundation

My work ethic comes from watching my father, an autodidactic electrical engineer from China, navigate a world that didn't recognize his brilliance. Despite deep technical knowledge, he had no formal education and immigrated here to work as a dishwasher—all to help pay for his father's woodworking factory, which eventually burned to the ground.

That fire nearly cost our family the ancestral home: a single roof in a small fishing village that sheltered three generations at once. Watching him engineer a life for us out of nothing, balancing manual labor with the precision of a self-taught mind, taught me what grit truly is.

To me, engineering isn't just a career. It's a survival mechanism—turning uncertainty into something measurable and actionable. And art? It's in everything I do and is the creative foundation that allows me apply my engineering mind in abstract ways.

## The Path

Over 15+ years, I've worked across biotech, high-scale consumer tech, publishing, and institutional finance. I've specialized in stepping into "void environments"—places where data exists at astronomical scale, but the systems to interpret and secure it don't.

Whether protecting digital identities of millions in consumer tech or securing high-value assets during complex financial acquisitions, the challenge was always the same: thinking simultaneously like an engineer, an adversary, and a human operator.

That dual perspective — engineer and adversary — is what makes security engineering work. I started on the defensive side, building systems. But I learned quickly that you can't protect what you don't understand from the attacker's perspective. Over time, the line between offense and defense dissolved entirely. The best security architects think like both — probing their own systems like an adversary so they can defend them like an engineer. That convergence is what I bring to neurosecurity.

## The Vision: Qinnovate > Mindloft > QIF

Everything I build is about my search for a better future, because if we cannot see it, we cannot design it.

**Qinnovate** is the engine — where forward thinking begins. **Mindloft** is the workshop — where research is built, developed, and shared. *"Let's Mind Our Way."* And **QIF** (Quantum Indeterministic Framework for Neural Security) is Mindloft's flagship research: security engineering grounded in neuroethics — developing rigorous, testable frameworks that protect the "crown jewels" of what makes us human — our unique cognitive fingerprints — as we enter the age of brain–computer interfaces.

Our minds deserve the same security architecture we've built for our networks. QIF is that architecture.

## The Precedent

In the 1970s, computer networks were fragmented — every manufacturer had its own proprietary system, and none of them could talk to each other. International teams spent 18 months debating how to organize network communication. Some proposed 5 layers, some 6, some 7. Charles Bachman provided the architectural vision that broke the deadlock: 7 layers, flexible enough to encompass every competing approach. That became the OSI model — the foundation the entire internet is built on.

They didn't wait until networking was "figured out." They built the framework while the technology was still evolving, and it shaped everything that followed.

When I was in Istanbul, I found a hidden gem — the oldest bookstore in the city. Inside, I discovered a copy of *The Development of the Periodic Law*, published in 1896 by F.P. Venable, Ph.D., Professor at the University of North Carolina. It only contained the original periodic elements — about 78 known at the time, before the discovery of noble gases. The book documents how the periodic table went through dozens of visual representations — circles, spirals, waves, towers — before arriving at the rectangular grid even children explore today. Mendeleev didn't just organize what was known — he left gaps for what wasn't. Those gaps predicted elements that were later discovered.

I carried an entire stack of books through Istanbul, to Morocco, and back home — like a father gripping onto their child with all their might through foreign territory. Airport security at every stop questioned why I had them. That journey fueled something in me: a hunger for yesterday to act as the foundation for tomorrow.

QIF follows the same principle. There are unknowns in neuroscience today — and that frontier is being challenged every day. Like the OSI model and the periodic table, QIF is a living framework: organizing what we know, highlighting what we don't, evolving as discovery fills in the gaps. From these foundations: limitless possibilities — security integration, automated signal detection through TARA, and directions we haven't yet imagined.

> — Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* 4.3

This is why I want to expand this work — collaborating with academics, researchers, and neuroscientists to refine QIF and establish ethical guidelines for where technology should and shouldn't intervene, for medical and safety reasons. The framework now includes [9 governance documents](MAIN/governance/) mapping technical controls to neuroethics principles, the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Neurotechnology (2025), and regulatory requirements across US federal, state, and international jurisdictions. This is a conversation I cannot have alone.

## Bigger Than Me

What began as a solo project to delve into my unknowns has taken form into something bigger than what I originally envisioned. I'm merely a small piece in the wonders that are larger than I can currently comprehend — and that's why I can't do it alone. I need more exploration, more academics to fill in the gaps and help us closer to a safer, more secure future. A world where we, and the visionaries of tomorrow, have the tools that not only safeguard them but add value and allow them to explore their inner hearts to the truest potential.

This project started from my heart, and to the mind.

I'm a calculated drop that creates forward momentum — a ripple that builds into a wave to shape the trajectory of tomorrow. All it takes is one small action to create a reaction.

But there are no waves without the pool of knowledge — the researchers, neuroscientists, and engineers whose work makes the water deep enough to carry them. The wave is metaphorical: research with the brightest minds, pooled together to make tomorrow better, together today.

Because the most important connections require the most thought, and *"our life is what our thoughts make it."*
