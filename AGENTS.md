| 2026-01-22 | Topic folders use `README.md`, main wiki uses `INDEX.md` | Documented in naming conventions |
| 2026-01-22 | Truth hierarchy: TechDoc > Python code > INDEX.md > README.md | Lower priority files must match higher priority sources |
| 2026-01-23 | BCI Anonymizer patent (US20140228701A1) was ABANDONED, never granted | Academic concepts freely implementable — added notes to neurosecurity module |

| 2026-01-23 | PyPI trusted publishing via GitHub Actions is more secure than storing tokens | No secrets in config, OIDC-based authentication |
| 2026-01-23 | INDEX.md must be updated when packages/structure change | Created INDEX.md Update Protocol in CLAUDE.md — check versions, folder structure, metrics |
| 2026-01-23 | Repository reorganized: governance/, project/, visualizations/ | prd.json→project/, ethics→governance/, oni-visualizations→visualizations/, processes→project/ |
| 2026-01-24 | Research Verification Protocol adapted from kevinqicode hallucination firewall | Domain-specific verification: SOCRATES (general), GÖDEL (math), FARADAY (physics/neuro) |

| 2026-01-26 | **Removed .vite cache from git tracking** | Build artifacts should never be committed. Used `git rm --cached` to untrack without deleting local files. |
| 2026-01-26 | **WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Compliance** | ONI Academy and TARA UIs now fully accessible. Color contrast (4.5:1 min), focus indicators, skip links, prefers-reduced-motion support. |
| 2026-01-26 | **Accessibility checker script created** | `check_accessibility.py` validates contrast ratios, font sizes, focus indicators, motion preferences, skip links. Exit codes: 0=pass, 1=fail, 2=error. |
| 2026-01-26 | **Accessibility workflow triggers on PyPI publish** | Changed from push/PR triggers to `workflow_run` on "Publish to PyPI" completion. Ensures every released version is accessibility-compliant. |
| 2026-01-26 | **Packages released: oni-framework 0.2.2, oni-tara 0.8.1** | Accessibility release with WCAG compliance, CHANGELOGs created/updated. |
| 2026-01-26 | **SRI hash mismatch caused GitHub Pages black screen** | AOS library (aos.js/aos.css) SRI hashes were incorrect, blocking browser from loading scripts. Content with `data-aos` stayed hidden (opacity: 0). Always verify SRI hashes match actual file content. |
| 2026-01-26 | **Security scanning with Bandit + nosec annotations** | Scanned all 3 PyPI packages. Added `# nosec` comments for reviewed patterns: B102 (exec for demos), B110 (fault-tolerant callbacks), B311 (random for UI), B105 (false positives). |
| 2026-01-26 | **Broken links fixed across repo** | Fixed: `06-oni-attack-matrix.html` → `06-oni-threat-matrix.html`, relative links → absolute GitHub URLs in READMEs for PyPI compatibility. |
| 2026-01-26 | **Packages released: oni-framework 0.2.4, oni-academy 0.1.4** | Link fixes, security annotations. oni-academy first public release. |

| 2026-01-26 | **TARA renamed: Platform → Stack** | "TARA Stack" aligns with monitoring/telemetry naming conventions (ELK Stack, TICK Stack). Updated brand.json + 14 files. QA pipeline now detects stale brand references. |
| 2026-01-26 | **QA pipeline created** | `qa.yml` workflow validates: brand consistency, Python imports, formula notation, documentation links, HTML security (CSP/SRI). Runs on PRs, pushes, and weekly. |
| 2026-01-29 | **Video production pipeline documented** | Complete CLAUDE.md for video work: frame-based timing, voiceover sync strategy, audio layering rules, visual-audio phase matching. See `MAIN/legacy-core/oni-product-demo/CLAUDE.md`. |
| 2026-01-29 | **ElevenLabs voice settings learned** | Bold voice: low stability (0.35), high style (0.6). Encouraging: medium stability (0.45), medium style (0.5). Standard narration: stability 0.5, style 0.5. |
| 2026-01-29 | **Audio bookend effect discovered** | Reusing intro sounds (ambient, pulse) at the end creates satisfying closure via musical "recapitulation" principle. |
| 2026-01-29 | **Harmonic progression 4th→5th→Major** | Used at intro and closing. Creates tension-resolution arc. Ding (4th) = question, Ding2 (5th) = answer coming, Chime (Major) = resolution. |
| 2026-01-29 | **Voice-reactive visuals pattern** | Calculate voice intensity based on frame timing (when voice is active), apply to scale transform for z-axis depth effect. See `CreditsScene.tsx`. |

### Patterns Established

- **Authoritative Source:** `TechDoc-ONI_Framework.md` is the single source of truth for 14-layer definitions
- **Cascade Sync:** Changes to TechDoc must propagate to README.md, INDEX.md, and verify against Python code
- **Hybrid Validation:** Auto-fix mechanical issues (dates, counts), require approval for content changes
- **CDN for GitHub Pages:** Use unpkg.com/CDN for JavaScript libraries (AOS, GSAP) to avoid npm dependencies and get auto-updates
- **Dependabot Grouping:** Group minor/patch updates together to reduce PR noise while catching security issues
- **Post-Publish Validation:** Accessibility checks run after PyPI publish (workflow_run trigger), not on every commit — ensures release quality without blocking development
- **PM Dashboard Pattern:** Create README.md in project folders with progress bars and metrics at top, quick links to detailed docs below — single entry point for navigation
- **Video Frame-Time Sync:** All timing in Remotion uses frames (30fps). Convert: `frame = seconds * 30`. Scene timestamps define boundaries; voiceovers sync via Sequence `from` offsets.
- **Audio Layering:** Voiceover 85-100%, SFX 40-60%, Ambient 25-40%. Duck ambient by 25% during voiceover.
- **Voice Settings Dial:** Lower stability = more dramatic/bold. Higher stability = more warm/encouraging. Style parameter adds expressiveness.

### Gotchas Avoided

- Never trust layer tables in README.md without cross-checking TechDoc
- The old model had L1-L7 as Biology — this is WRONG. Correct: L1-L7 = Silicon
- README.md files don't auto-update when TechDoc changes — Editor Agent sync_rules.md handles this
- **INDEX.md must be updated when moving files or changing packages** — Python Packages, Dependency Map, Folder Structure, and Metrics sections all need updating
- **Folder names in INDEX.md can drift from reality** — e.g., `siem/` vs actual `nsam/`, always verify against filesystem
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: L9-L14 are BIOLOGY, not Silicon** — Even though L9-L10 involve signal processing/protocols, they operate on the BRAIN SIDE of the L8 bridge. This error appeared in 6+ files on 2026-01-24 and was systematically corrected. Memory aid: Below bridge (L1-L7) = computers. Above bridge (L9-L14) = brains.
- **⚠️ SRI hashes must be verified when adding CDN libraries** — Calculate hash with `curl -s URL | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A`. Wrong hash = browser blocks script = black screen. Symptom: page loads but content invisible, animations don't work.
- **Relative links in README.md break on PyPI** — PyPI renders README standalone; use absolute GitHub URLs for cross-file links.
- **Brand renames require updating 14+ files** — brand.json is source of truth, but Python fallbacks (_brand.py), docs, video scripts, and visualizations all have hardcoded references. QA pipeline now catches stale references.
- **Video-Audio Sync:** Always measure actual audio duration with ffprobe before setting frame timing. Generated audio may be shorter/longer than expected.
- **Fade audio at scene boundaries** — Without fade-out, audio bleeds into next scene. Use `interpolate(f, [duration-30, duration], [1, 0])` for 1-second fade.
- **Voice iterations required** — "Bold" vs "encouraging" voice settings produce very different results. User may need 2-3 iterations to find the right tone.
- **Complex visual effects may be rejected** — User rejected black hole collapse effect ("too dark") and spiral graphics ("bad"). Simpler approaches often work better.
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: Check dependencies before deleting files** (2026-02-06) — CNAME incident: removed root CNAME without checking GitHub Pages config. Pages was serving from /docs so CNAME belonged there, not root. ALWAYS check what a file does before removing.
- **CNAME location matters:** GitHub Pages serving from /docs looks for CNAME in /docs, not root. Check Pages configuration before file operations.

## Operational Protocols (Post-Mortems)

### Critical Pattern: Moving Too Fast

**Identified:** 2026-02-06 (CNAME incident, circular diagram failures)

**Problem:** Repeated pattern of acting before fully understanding, pattern matching instead of thinking, not visualizing consequences.

### Mandatory Pre-Flight Checks (LOADED FROM MEMORY.md)

**Before ANY File Deletion:**
1. Ask: What is this file for? (Read it if needed)
2. Check: What depends on it? (grep for references, check configs)
3. Verify: Is it actually unused? (git log, Pages config, build scripts)
4. Example failure: CNAME removal without checking GitHub Pages config

**Before Creating Diagrams/Visualizations:**
1. Visualize first: Picture the structure before coding
2. Read instructions twice: Don't pattern-match to previous work
3. Check examples: If user provides reference images, look at them
4. Example failure: VERA circular diagram made vertical twice despite "circle" instruction

**Before ANY Git Push:**
1. Review the diff: What exactly am I changing?
2. Run security audit: For qinnovate/mindloft repos
3. Consider blast radius: Who/what depends on these changes?

### General Operating Principles

- **Slow down on destructive operations** (rm, delete, overwrite)
- **When uncertain, ask before acting** — cost of confirmation < cost of mistake
- **Read config files before assuming** — don't rely on memory/patterns
- **Post-mortems must change behavior** — documenting failures isn't enough

### Session Checkpoints

- If I catch myself "moving fast" → pause, ask what I might be missing
- If user says "are you sure?" → stop, recheck assumptions
- After any mistake → update MEMORY.md Post-Mortem Protocols section

## Persona System Learnings

### The ONI Research Personas

| Persona | Archetype | Domain | Key Question |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **AURORA** | Illuminator | Main reasoning | "What's the insight?" |
| **SOCRATES** | Questioner | General verification | "What evidence supports this?" |
| **GÖDEL** | Logician | Math/formulas | "Does this formula hold?" |
| **FARADAY** | Experimentalist | Physics/neuroscience | "What does the science say?" |
| **HYPATIA** | Librarian | Documentation | "Where does this belong?" |
| **ARCHIMEDES** | Pragmatist | Project management | "What's the lever?" |
| **EDITOR** | Validator | Cross-references | "Is this consistent?" |

### Research Verification Protocol

Adapted from kevinqicode anti-hallucination firewall for academic research:

**4-Layer Architecture:**
```
Truth Layer      → Authoritative sources (papers, patents, specs)
Grounding Engine → Extract claims with citations
Firewall         → Domain-specific verification (SOCRATES/GÖDEL/FARADAY)
Publication      → Only verified content
```

**Uncertainty Tags:**
- ✅ VERIFIED — Peer-reviewed source, safe to use
- ⚠️ INFERRED — Logical inference, must label
- 🔍 UNVERIFIED — No source, do NOT use
- ❌ CONTRADICTED — Evidence against, do NOT use
- 🔬 HYPOTHESIS — Novel ONI contribution, label clearly

### Folder Structure for Verification

```
MAIN/legacy-core/resources/pipeline/
├── sources/                    # Authoritative documents
│   ├── papers/                 # Peer-reviewed
│   ├── patents/                # Patents
│   ├── specs/                  # Standards
│   └── data/                   # Datasets
├── verified/                   # Verified claims with citations
└── ...
```

### Key Patterns

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Domain personas prevent cross-domain errors | FARADAY catches physics errors GÖDEL misses |
| Tension between personas is valuable | SOCRATES questions what AURORA proposes |
| Uncertainty tags force explicit epistemic states | No more confident hallucinations |
| Verified claims file creates audit trail | Academic credibility requires traceability |

### Common Errors Caught

| Error Type | Persona | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Timescale confusion | FARADAY | "10 ms" instead of "100 fs" quantum coherence |
| Uniform reliability | FARADAY | AI suggesting 0.95 instead of biological 0.85 |
| Formula mismatch | GÖDEL | TechDoc formula differs from Python code |
| Missing citation | SOCRATES | Confident claim with no source |

## Neurosecurity Implementation Learnings

### Key Discoveries

| Date | Discovery | Implementation |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 2026-01-23 | Kohno (2009) defines 3 threat categories: Alteration, Blocking, Eavesdropping | Maps to CIA triad: Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality |
| 2026-01-23 | Bonaci (2015) BCI privacy filtering uses ERP component stripping | Implemented P300, N170, N400, ERN, LRP, CNV filters with sensitivity levels |
| 2026-01-23 | Privacy Score = weighted ERP sensitivity across signal components | PrivacyScoreCalculator with configurable weights |

### Module Structure

```
oni-framework/oni/neurosecurity/
├── __init__.py       # Exports, patent status note
├── firewall.py       # NeurosecurityFirewall (Kohno CIA triad)
├── anonymizer.py     # BCIAnonymizer (ERP filtering)
├── threats.py        # ThreatType enum, KohnoThreatModel
└── privacy_score.py  # PrivacyScoreCalculator
```

### TARA Integration

Created `tara/MAIN/integration.py` with 12 Kohno-based detection rules:
- Signal injection, neural DoS, cognitive leakage (base threats)
- Amplitude bounds, frequency analysis, spatial filtering (validation)
- Cross-layer correlation, behavioral deviation, cognitive fingerprinting (advanced)

## PyPI Publishing Learnings

### GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Create PyPI project (or pending publisher) | Project name must match pyproject.toml |
| 2 | Configure trusted publisher on PyPI | Repository, workflow file, environment name |
| 3 | Use `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` action | `id-token: write` permission required |
| 4 | Configure environment in workflow | `environment: name: pypi` |

### Package Naming

- `oni-framework` — Core library (PyPI)
- `oni-tara` — TARA neural security platform (PyPI)
- Renamed from `tara-neural` to `oni-tara` for brand consistency

### Workflow Configuration

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write  # Required for trusted publishing
environment:
  name: pypi
  url: https://pypi.org/p/package-name
```

---

## Publishing Learnings

### Content Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Keywords must be extracted to `keywords.json` | Research monitor depends on it |
| APA tables: numbers **BOLD**, titles *ITALIC* | Template compliance |
| Blog front-matter requires RFC 2822 date format | Medium compatibility |
| Sub-Tags footer required on all blog posts | Consistency |

### File Placement

| Content Type | Location | Wrong Location |
|--------------|----------|----------------|
| Blog posts | `publications/[topic]/` | `resources/` |
| TechDocs | `publications/[topic]/` | Root |
| Templates | `resources/templates/` | `publications/` |
| Editor checks | `resources/editor/checks/` | Anywhere else |

### Naming Conventions

```
Folders:   lowercase-hyphenated     (neural-firewall)
Blogs:     Blog-Topic_Name.md       (Blog-Neural_Firewall.md)
TechDocs:  TechDoc-Topic_Name.md    (TechDoc-Neural_Firewall.md)
```

---

## Cross-Reference Learnings

### Dependency Chain

```
ONI Framework (base)
    ├── Coherence Metric
    │   ├── Neural Firewall
    │   │   └── Neural Ransomware
    │   └── Scale-Frequency
    │       └── Quantum Encryption
    └── All other topics
```

### Common Sync Failures

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Layer names don't match | README not updated after TechDoc change | Run Editor Agent layer_validation |
| Broken internal links | File renamed without link update | Run Editor Agent sync_rules |
| Stale dates in footer | Manual process skipped | Auto-fix via Editor Agent |
| Wrong document count | New file added, footer not updated | Auto-fix via Editor Agent |
| INDEX.md shows wrong folder names | File/folder moved without updating INDEX.md | Follow INDEX.md Update Protocol |
| INDEX.md shows outdated versions | Package version changed without updating metrics | Update Python Packages and Metrics sections |
| INDEX.md dependency map stale | New package/component added without diagram update | Redraw dependency map in INDEX.md |

---

## Session Patterns

### What Works

1. **Read CLAUDE.md first** — Contains all conventions and workflows
2. **Run Editor Agent before commits** — Catches inconsistencies early
3. **Cross-reference TechDocs** — They are the authoritative source
4. **Update AGENTS.md after discoveries** — Knowledge compounds for next session

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Trusting derived files** — README.md, INDEX.md can drift from TechDoc
2. **Manual date/count updates** — Error-prone, let Editor Agent handle
3. **Assuming consistency** — Always validate with Editor Agent
4. **Skipping layer validation** — The 14-layer inversion bug proves this

| Coherence Score | Cₛ = e^(−(σ²φ + σ²τ + σ²γ)) | TechDoc-Coherence_Metric |
| Scale-Frequency | f × S ≈ k | TechDoc-Scale_Frequency |

---

## Project Management Learnings

### PM System Architecture

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md** | `MAIN/legacy-core/project/` | Master doc: scope, risks, priorities, milestones, metrics |
| **KANBAN.md** | `MAIN/legacy-core/project/` | Visual board: Backlog → To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done |
| **prd.json** | `MAIN/legacy-core/project/` | Machine-readable task data with exit conditions |

### Risk Impact Assessment (RIA)

**Formula:** `Risk Score = Likelihood (1-5) × Impact (1-5)`

| Score Range | Level | Action |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| 1-4 | Low | Accept/monitor |
| 5-9 | Medium | Mitigate |
| 10-14 | High | Mitigate actively |
| 15-25 | Critical | Avoid or escalate |

### Priority Framework

| Level | Meaning | SLA |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **P0** | Blocks all work, security/data issue | Immediate |
| **P1** | Important for current milestone | Same sprint |
| **P2** | Nice to have, incremental improvement | Next sprint |
| **P3** | Future enhancement, exploration | Backlog |

### Key Patterns

- **WIP Limits:** 3 in progress, 2 in review — prevents overcommitment
- **Exit Conditions:** Every task must have machine-verifiable completion criteria
- **Scope Change Requests:** Document impact before approving new features
- **Milestone-Driven:** Q1-Q4 2026 roadmap with clear deliverables

### Critical Risks Identified

| Risk | Score | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| No empirical Cₛ validation | 16 (Critical) | Open — MOABB benchmarks planned |
| Single contributor (bus factor=1) | 20 (Critical) | Monitoring — documentation helps |
| Code-documentation drift | 9 (Medium) | Mitigated — Editor Agent |

---

## Future Iteration Notes

### Pending Investigations

- [ ] Verify all topic README.md files have correct layer references
- [ ] Check if Python code in `oni-framework/oni/layers.py` matches TechDoc
- [ ] Validate formula representations are consistent across all documents

### Suggested Improvements

- Add formula regex validation to Editor Agent
- Create automated CHANGELOG.md generation
- Implement git hooks to auto-run Editor Agent

| **Tests** | `tests.yml` | Matrix testing (Python 3.9-3.12, Ubuntu/macOS) | push, PR, manual |
| **Security** | `security.yml` | Bandit, Safety, CodeQL scanning | push, PR, weekly schedule, manual |
| **Publish** | `publish.yml` | Trusted publishing to PyPI | manual dispatch |

### Security Scanning Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Configuration |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Bandit** | Python code security | `--severity-level medium --confidence-level medium` |
| **Safety** | Dependency vulnerabilities | `--full-report` |
| **CodeQL** | Advanced code analysis | `security-and-quality` queries |

### Key Patterns

- **Matrix Testing:** Test across multiple Python versions and OS combinations simultaneously
- **Trusted Publishing:** Use OIDC tokens instead of API keys for PyPI publishing
- **Weekly Scans:** Schedule security scans weekly (cron: `0 9 * * 1`) to catch new vulnerabilities
- **Artifact Upload:** Store scan results as artifacts with 30-day retention
- **Continue on Error:** Use `|| true` for informational scans that shouldn't fail the build
- **Summary Reports:** Write to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` for visual workflow summaries

### Gotchas

- **Bandit `-uall` flag:** Never use `-uall` with git status on large repos — can cause memory issues
- **Path triggers:** Use path filters to avoid running tests on unrelated changes
- **Artifact paths:** Download artifacts to specific directories to avoid conflicts
- **CodeQL permissions:** Requires `security-events: write` permission

## Brand System Learnings

### Architecture

```
MAIN/legacy-core/resources/brand/brand.json      ← Single source of truth
    │
    ├── oni/brand.py           ← Python API for ONI Framework
    ├── tara_mvp/_brand.py     ← Python API for TARA (no oni dependency)
    ├── oni_academy/_brand.py  ← Python API for ONI Academy
    │
    ├── MAIN/legacy-core/resources/brand/sync_brand.py  ← Syncs to README.md, docs/index.html
    │
    └── docs/index.html        ← JavaScript fetches from GitHub raw URL
```

### What Gets Synced

| Source Field | Target File | Pattern |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `oni.full_name` | README.md | `**ONI** (Full Name) —` |
| `oni.tagline` | README.md | `*Tagline*` (italicized line) |
| `oni.slogan` | README.md | `**Slogan**` (bold line) |
| `tara.full_name` | README.md | `**TARA** (Full Name) is` |
| `oni.mission` | docs/index.html | `<p id="mission-text">` |

### Sync Triggers

| Trigger | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Automatic** | GitHub Action on push to `main` when `MAIN/legacy-core/resources/brand/brand.json` changes |
| **Manual** | `python MAIN/legacy-core/resources/brand/sync_brand.py` |
| **Dynamic** | docs/index.html fetches from raw.githubusercontent.com at runtime |

### Key Patterns

- **Fallback values:** Python _brand.py files have hardcoded defaults for pip-installed packages without repo access
- **Path flexibility:** Brand loaders try multiple paths to find brand.json in different installation contexts
- **Generic regex:** Sync patterns use flexible regex (e.g., any bold line) rather than matching exact old values

### Gotchas

- `.gitignore` belongs in repo root, NOT `.github/` — the latter only applies to that subdirectory
- README.md is static markdown — cannot dynamically load values like HTML/JavaScript can
- When moving brand.json, must update: all _brand.py paths, sync_brand.py, workflow trigger, docs/index.html fetch URL

## Session Memory Protocol

> **How to use the Session Memory section effectively.**

### At Session Start
1. Read **Session Memory** section first (top of file)
2. Check **Current Workstreams** for active projects
3. Check **User Preferences** to respect past decisions
4. Check **Pending Items** for carry-over tasks
5. Read **Recent Session Context** for immediate continuity

### At Session End
1. Update **Current Workstreams** status
2. Add any new **User Preferences** discovered
3. Move completed items out of **Pending Items**
4. Write 3-5 bullet **Recent Session Context** summary
5. Add significant learnings to appropriate sections below

### What Goes Where

| Information Type | Location |
|------------------|----------|
| Quick session context | Session Memory → Recent Session Context |
| User preferences/decisions | Session Memory → User Preferences |
| Active project status | Session Memory → Current Workstreams |
| Reusable patterns | Patterns Established sections |
| Mistakes to avoid | Gotchas Avoided sections |
| Technical discoveries | Critical Discoveries tables |
