## ⚠️ The Fundamental Flaw

```
v1 model (WRONG):

    L14  Identity           ╲
    L13  Semantic             │  Biology
    L12  Cognitive Session    │
    L11  Cognitive Transport  │
    L10  Neural Protocol      │
    L9   Signal Processing   ╱
    ────────────────────────────
    L8   Neural Gateway  ◄── placed here, middle of stack
    ────────────────────────────
    L7   Application         ╲
    L6   Presentation         │
    L5   Session              │  OSI
    L4   Transport            │
    L3   Network              │
    L2   Data Link            │
    L1   Physical Carrier    ╱

    PROBLEM: BCIs are physical hardware.
    An electrode array is a PHYSICAL device touching PHYSICAL tissue.
    The neural interface belongs adjacent to L1, not at L8.
```

## 🔴 Three Problems This Creates

### 🔌 Problem 1: Misplaced Interface

A BCI electrode is hardware — copper, platinum, silicon. It belongs at the physical layer.
Putting it at L8 implies 7 layers of abstraction between the physical world and the brain.
In reality, the electrode IS the physical contact point. L1 and the neural interface are the same boundary.

### 👤 Problem 2: Identity as a Layer

v1 placed "Identity & Ethics" as L14 — the top of the stack.
Identity involves consciousness. We cannot:
- Define its dataflow
- Measure its dependency chain
- Prove its mechanisms
- Interface with it via BCI

**If we can't define it, we can't layer it. If we can't layer it, we can't secure it.**

We do not model consciousness. That is not our job.

### 🔄 Problem 3: Linear Stack for a Non-Linear System

The brain is not a pipeline. It is loops within loops:

```
Reflex:       Receptor → Spinal cord → Muscle                    (~50ms)
Subcortical:  Receptor → Thalamus → Amygdala → Response          (~100ms)
Cortical:     Receptor → Thalamus → Cortex → Decision → Action   (~500ms+)
```

A linear 14-layer stack cannot represent multiple parallel loops
at different depths operating simultaneously.

## ✅ What Stays

- 🔗 The concept that silicon and biology need a unified security model
- 🛡️ The idea of a chokepoint/firewall at the interface boundary
- 📊 Dependency-based layering (proven by both OSI and neuroscience)
- 📐 The mathematical scaling pattern (~1.1 orders of magnitude per layer)

## ❌ What Goes

- 🗑️ 14-layer combined stack
- 🗑️ Identity/consciousness as a layer
- 🗑️ L8 as a "middle bridge"
- 🗑️ Pyramid/triangle visualization
- 🗑️ Any layer we cannot prove dataflow for
