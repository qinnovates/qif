Neuralink has implanted its first human patients. Synchron is in FDA
trials. Blackrock Neurotech has been in human brains since 2004.

These devices are tested for safety and efficacy. They are not tested
against adversarial threats.

I've spent 15 years in cyber threat intelligence. I've watched
industries build first and secure later. I don't want to see that happen
with technology that interfaces directly with human cognition.

# The Gap

Existing neuroethics frameworks address important questions: informed
consent, cognitive liberty, mental privacy. What they don't address is
adversarial security at the signal layer.

- What does a malicious input look like at the neural interface?

- How do we authenticate signals between device and brain?

- Where are the layer boundaries, and what are the attack surfaces at
  each?

We have no shared vocabulary for these questions.

# A Proposed Starting Point

I'm publishing an open framework called **ONI (Organic Network
Interface)** - a 14-layer model that extends the OSI stack into
biological territory.

- **Layers 1-7:** Traditional OSI

- **Layers 8-10:** Neural interface domain (electrodes, local field
  potentials, oscillatory patterns)

- **Layers 11-14:** Cognitive domain (working memory, attention,
  executive function, identity)

This is not a finished product. It's a scaffold that needs
neuroscientists, AI safety researchers, and BCI engineers to
stress-test, correct, and extend.

# What I'm Asking For

Read the paper. Tell me what's wrong. The biological layers especially
need expert review - I'm a security person, not a neuroscientist.

If this framework is useful, it won't be because I got it right. It'll
be because the right people helped fix it.
