*A Unified Neuro-Computational Stack for Secure Bio-Digital Integration*

Kevin L. Qi

# Abstract

This paper proposes a unified layered framework—the Organic Network
Interface (ONI) Model—for reasoning about the integration of biological
neural systems with artificial intelligence. Extending the established
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model beyond its traditional seven
layers, we introduce seven additional organic layers (L8–L14) that
characterize the brain's electrochemical, structural, and cognitive
architecture.  
  
The framework employs category-theoretic abstractions to formalize
structure-preserving mappings between biological systems, AI
architectures, and governance frameworks. By treating neural tissue as
an organic network interface subject to entropy, attack surfaces, and
coherence constraints, this work provides a defensible abstraction for
identifying failure modes, security vulnerabilities, and governance
checkpoints in emerging bio-digital systems.  
  
This work does not claim to explain consciousness, nor does it attempt
to unify neuroscience and artificial intelligence under a single
mechanistic theory. Instead, it proposes a practical,
structure-preserving framework compatible with existing compliance
regimes such as FDA Class III medical device regulations. The ONI
Framework is designed to be species-agnostic, applicable to any neural
system—from animal research models to human clinical applications.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 The Problem: No Framework for Organic Network Security

As brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transition from research prototypes
to FDA-regulated medical devices, a critical gap emerges: while the OSI
model provides a standardized framework for securing digital
communications, no equivalent abstraction exists for the organic-digital
boundary.  
  
The trajectory of technology suggests an inevitable convergence. If we
can already interface with neural tissue using wireless nodes (as
demonstrated by Neuralink and similar technologies), and if all complex
systems are subject to entropy and vulnerabilities, then we must
anticipate attack vectors before they become exploitable zero-day
vulnerabilities.  
  
This paper addresses this gap by proposing the Organic Network Interface
(ONI) Framework—a scale-aware, frequency-aware, and energy-aware
communication stack that bridges machines and biological systems. The
term "Organic Network Interface" was chosen deliberately to:  
  
• Emphasize species-agnosticism: The framework applies equally to animal
research models and human applications  
• Parallel established IT terminology: "Network Interface" is
immediately recognizable to the security and engineering communities  
• Capture the biological substrate: "Organic" distinguishes living
neural tissue from silicon-based systems

## 1.2 Core Principles

The ONI Framework is built on the following foundational principles:  
  
1. Layered Abstraction: Each layer operates at characteristic
frequencies, spatial scales, and energy profiles.  
  
2. Scale Invariance: As we ascend the stack, frequency decreases while
spatial scale and semantic compression increase.  
  
3. Structure Preservation: Coherence—not mere signal transmission—is the
fundamental invariant that must be maintained across layers.  
  
4. Security by Design: Each layer boundary represents a potential attack
surface requiring specific defensive measures.  
  
5. Species Agnosticism: The framework applies to any neural system
capable of interfacing with digital technology, from rodent models to
primate studies to human clinical applications.

# 2. Mathematical Foundations

## 2.1 The Scale-Frequency Relationship

A fundamental pattern emerges across all layers of the ONI stack: an
inverse relationship between operational frequency and spatial scale.
This can be expressed mathematically as:

**f × S ≈ k**

Where:  
• f = characteristic frequency (Hz)  
• S = spatial scale (meters)  
• k = scale-frequency constant (approximately 10⁶ m·Hz for neural
systems)

## 2.2 Coherence Metric

Signal coherence (Cₛ) represents the fundamental measure of information
integrity across layers. We define coherence as:

**Cₛ = e^(−(σ²ᵩ + σ²τ + σ²ᵧ))**

Where:  
• σ²ᵩ = phase variance (timing jitter)  
• σ²τ = transport variance (structural integrity)  
• σ²ᵧ = gain variance (amplitude stability)  
  
When Cₛ → 1, the signal maintains full structural integrity. When Cₛ →
0, information is effectively lost despite continued signal propagation.

## 2.3 Category-Theoretic Formalization

Category theory provides the formal language for reasoning about
structure-preserving mappings across the ONI framework. We define three
primary categories:

𝓑 (Biological Systems): Objects are neural structures; morphisms are
signal propagation pathways.  
  
𝓐 (AI/Artificial Systems): Objects are computational units; morphisms
are information transformations.  
  
𝓖 (Governance Systems): Objects are compliance checkpoints; morphisms
are validation protocols.

Functors and Natural Transformations:  
  
• F: 𝓑 → 𝓐 maps biological coherence to AI architecture constraints  
• G: 𝓐 → 𝓖 maps AI invariants to governance checkpoints  
• η: F ⇒ G ensures coherence is preserved throughout the coevolution
process

# 3. The ONI Layered Model

The ONI Framework consists of 14 layers organized into three domains:
the Digital Domain (L1–L7, traditional OSI), the Neural Interface Domain
(L8–L10), and the Cognitive Domain (L11–L14). Each layer is
characterized by its function, dominant signals, frequency range,
spatial scale, and security considerations.

## 3.1 Design Principles for Layer Naming

Layer names have been designed for intuitive comprehension while
maintaining scientific accuracy. Each name reflects the layer's primary
function using organic, accessible terminology:  
  
• Lower layers use terms emphasizing physical and electrical
properties  
• Middle layers use terms emphasizing transport and encoding  
• Higher layers use terms emphasizing cognition and identity  
  
The naming convention follows the pattern: \[Domain\]-\[Function\] where
applicable.

# 4. Detailed Layer Analysis with Biological Examples

## 4.1 Neural Interface Domain (L8–L10)

**Layer 8: Neural Gateway**

The Neural Gateway represents the critical boundary between silicon and
carbon—the physical interface where digital signals meet biological
tissue. This layer is analogous to the physical layer (L1) but operates
at biological frequencies. In the ONI Framework, L8 serves as the
primary ingress/egress point—analogous to how a fortress gate is both
the entry point and the most critical point to defend.  
  
Key Biological Components:  
• Electrode arrays (Utah arrays: 96-channel, 400μm spacing)  
• Neuralink N1 chip (1,024 electrodes per thread)  
• Electrocorticography (ECoG) grids  
• Peripheral nerve interfaces  
  
Signal Characteristics:  
• Action potentials: ~100 mV amplitude, 1-2 ms duration  
• Local field potentials: 10-1000 μV, 1-500 Hz  
• Signal-to-noise ratio: typically 5:1 to 20:1  
  
Research Model Considerations:  
• Rodent models: Smaller electrode arrays, higher spatial density
requirements  
• Primate models: Closer anatomical analogy to human applications  
• Human applications: FDA Class III regulatory pathway

**Layer 9: Ion Channel Encoding**

This layer handles the translation between neural spike codes and
interpretable digital representations. Ion channels serve as the
biological equivalent of transistors—gating information flow based on
voltage thresholds.  
  
Key Biological Components:  
• Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels (rapid depolarization, ~1 ms)  
• Voltage-gated K⁺ channels (repolarization, ~2-4 ms)  
• Ca²⁺ channels (neurotransmitter release trigger)  
• NMDA receptors (coincidence detection, learning)  
• AMPA receptors (fast excitatory transmission)  
  
Neurotransmitter Examples at Different Timescales:  
• Glutamate: Fast excitation (1-10 ms postsynaptic response)  
• GABA: Fast inhibition (1-10 ms)  
• Acetylcholine: Modulation (10-100 ms)  
• Dopamine: Reward signaling (100 ms phasic, minutes tonic)  
• Serotonin: Mood modulation (seconds to hours)

**Layer 10: Oscillatory Synchronization**

Neural oscillations provide the temporal coordination necessary for
information routing across brain regions. Different frequency bands
serve distinct cognitive functions.  
  
Oscillation Frequency Bands:  
• Delta (δ): 0.5–4 Hz — Deep sleep, cortical inhibition  
• Theta (θ): 4–8 Hz — Memory encoding, spatial navigation  
• Alpha (α): 8–12 Hz — Relaxed wakefulness, inhibitory gating  
• Beta (β): 13–30 Hz — Active thinking, motor planning  
• Gamma (γ): 30–100 Hz — Attention, sensory binding, consciousness  
  
Cross-Frequency Coupling:  
The theta-gamma code in the hippocampus exemplifies hierarchical
temporal organization: 4-8 distinct gamma cycles (representing
individual memory items) nest within each theta cycle, enabling
sequential encoding of multiple items.

## 4.2 Cognitive Domain (L11–L14)

The Cognitive Domain encompasses the higher-order processing that
transforms raw neural activity into thought, intention, and identity.  
  
Layer 11 (Cognitive Session) Examples:  
• Prefrontal cortex maintaining task rules  
• Parietal cortex tracking spatial attention  
• Working memory capacity: 4±1 items (Cowan's limit)  
  
Layer 12 (Semantic Assembly) Examples:  
• Temporal lobe semantic representations  
• Wernicke's area language comprehension  
• Concept cells (e.g., "Jennifer Aniston neurons")  
  
Layer 13 (Intent & Agency) Examples:  
• Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: goal maintenance  
• Anterior cingulate cortex: conflict monitoring  
• Dopaminergic reward prediction (VTA → NAcc pathway)  
  
Layer 14 (Identity & Ethics) Examples:  
• Default Mode Network: self-referential processing  
• Medial prefrontal cortex: self-concept  
• Hippocampal autobiographical memory  
• Orbitofrontal cortex: moral reasoning

# 5. Security Framework: Organic Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures

Extending the MITRE ATT&CK framework concept to biological systems, we
propose an Organic TTP taxonomy for anticipating and defending against
attacks on neural interfaces. This framework applies across all research
and clinical applications of the ONI model.

## 5.1 Attack Surface by Layer

| **Layer** | **Attack Vector** | **Example Technique** | **Defense Strategy** |
|----|----|----|----|
| L8 | Signal Injection | Malicious stimulation patterns | Hardware attestation, signal validation |
| L9 | Encoding Manipulation | Spike train replay attacks | Temporal signatures, anomaly detection |
| L10 | Desynchronization | Disrupting gamma rhythms | Phase-locking monitoring, rhythm enforcement |
| L11 | Cognitive Disruption | Attention hijacking | Working memory integrity checks |
| L12 | Semantic Inference | Thought reconstruction | On-device processing, differential privacy |
| L13 | Goal Manipulation | Reward signal hacking | Agency verification, intent logging |
| L14 | Identity Compromise | Personality alteration | Long-term pattern monitoring, ethical bounds |

## 5.2 The Organic Firewall Concept

Analogous to network firewalls that inspect and filter traffic at
network boundaries, an "organic firewall" would operate at L8—the Neural
Gateway—implementing:  
  
1. Signal Validation: Verifying that incoming stimulation patterns match
authorized signatures  
2. Anomaly Detection: Identifying abnormal neural activity patterns that
may indicate attack or malfunction  
3. Access Control: Enforcing policies about which systems can read from
or write to specific neural regions  
4. Audit Logging: Maintaining tamper-resistant records of all interface
interactions  
  
This architecture follows Zero Trust principles: no signal is trusted by
default, regardless of origin. The ONI Framework positions L8 as the
critical control point—the "gate" of the organic fortress that requires
the most robust defenses.

# 6. Governance and Regulatory Alignment

The ONI Framework is designed to be compatible with existing regulatory
frameworks, particularly FDA Class III medical device requirements for
brain-computer interfaces.  
  
Key compliance mappings:  
  
• FDA 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation): Layer-specific
quality controls  
• IEC 62304 (Medical Device Software): Software lifecycle requirements
for L1-L7  
• ISO 14971 (Risk Management): Attack surface analysis per layer  
• HIPAA: Data protection requirements for L11-L14 cognitive data  
• IACUC Protocols: Animal research compliance for pre-clinical ONI
studies  
  
The category-theoretic formalization enables automated compliance
verification through functorial mappings between system states and
regulatory requirements. Importantly, the ONI Framework's
species-agnostic design allows consistent governance from animal
research through human clinical trials.

# 7. Limitations and Non-Claims

To avoid overextension and misinterpretation, we explicitly state the
boundaries of this work:  
  
1. Not a Theory of Consciousness: This framework does not attempt to
explain subjective experience, qualia, or the ontological nature of
consciousness.  
  
2. Not a Biological Mechanism Claim: References to biological structures
illustrate structural roles and constraints, not causality in cognitive
processing.  
  
3. Not Empirically Validated: The framework guides future empirical work
and system design but does not replace controlled experimentation.  
  
4. Not a Unifying Physical Theory: Category theory is employed as a
formal language for structure-preserving mappings, not as an assertion
about the fundamental nature of cognition.  
  
5. No Guaranteed Safety: While the framework enables reasoning about
failure modes, it does not guarantee alignment or safety under all
conditions.  
  
6. Species-Specific Variations: While the ONI Framework is designed to
be species-agnostic, specific parameter values (frequencies, timescales,
spatial scales) will vary across species and must be calibrated
empirically.  
  
In summary, this framework claims usefulness, not completeness;
structure, not ontology; and risk reduction, not elimination.

# 8. Future Work

1\. Organic TTP Scenario Modeling: Develop scenario-based attack
simulations analogous to cyber kill chains.  
  
2. Biological Signature Identification: Define measurable markers
correlated with coherence loss or adversarial influence.  
  
3. Detection and Response Policies: Create organic detection playbooks
analogous to SOC procedures.  
  
4. AI Safety Integration: Enable joint monitoring of biological and
artificial agents for co-evolutionary governance.  
  
5. Validation Through Animal Models: Test the framework using
established neuroscience research models before human application.  
  
6. Cross-Species Calibration: Establish ONI parameter mappings across
commonly used research species (rodent, primate, human).

# 9. Conclusion

The Organic Network Interface (ONI) Framework provides a structured
abstraction for reasoning about the integration of biological and
artificial intelligence systems. By extending the OSI model with seven
organic layers characterized by frequency, scale, and coherence
properties, the framework enables:  
  
• Systematic identification of attack surfaces across the bio-digital
boundary  
• Formal reasoning about structure preservation through
category-theoretic mappings  
• Alignment with existing regulatory and compliance frameworks  
• Proactive defense against emerging threats to neural interfaces  
• Consistent methodology from animal research through human clinical
applications  
  
As brain-computer interfaces transition from research to regulated
medical devices, frameworks like ONI become essential for ensuring that
bio-digital integration proceeds safely and ethically—regardless of the
species under study.  
  
"Intelligence—biological or artificial—fails not when signals disappear,
but when structure fails. This is our framework for the future."
