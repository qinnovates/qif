// ANIMATION NOTES:
// - Scene 4 (Coherence): Show threshold trigger → defense mechanism activation
//   - Visual: Gauge drops below threshold → shield/alert animation
//   - Examples: MRI interference, electromagnetic disruption, injection attacks
// - Scene 4 (Scale-Frequency): Animated visualization of f × S ≈ k
//   - Scale bar grows (10→1000), Frequency shrinks (100→1 Hz), k stays ~1000
// - Scene 6 ("...and you"): SLOW PAN-IN with WHITE TEXT for emphasis
// - TARA scene: REMOVED "100% open source" line
